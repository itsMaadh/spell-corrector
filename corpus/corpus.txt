Middle East respiratory syndrome Severe acute respiratory syndrome Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 The world is amidst a pandemic that is presenting one of the greatest public health challenges of the twenty first century A new coronavirus has jumped the interspe cies barrier and it possesses the capability of efficient person to person transmis sion and selectively kills older people and those with underlying chronic conditions Since its emergence the new coronavirus has resulted in 43 7 million infections and over 1 million deaths as of October 25 2020 20 of deaths are in the United States followed by Brazil 14 India 10 Mexico 7 8 and the United Kingdom 4 1 The new disease emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan China and the early cases appeared to be associated with a local wholesale fish and live animal market 2 The cluster of patients exhibited respiratory features of pneumonia and acute respi ratory distress syndrome as seen in the severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS coronavirus of 2002 2003 leading the scientists to suspect a virus of zoonotic ori gins On December 31 the Chinese authorities informed the World Health Organization WHO of the outbreak putting the organization on emergency foot ing 3 The WHO issued comprehensive technical guidance online with advise to all countries on how to detect test and manage emerging infections based on previous experience with SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS outbreak of 2012 4 In mid January Chinese authorities announced a novel coronavirus with genetic structure similar to SARS 80 and with its origins in bats it was the cause of the new disease 5 The virus was officially named the severe acute respira tory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 and the disease it caused the Coronavirus Disease 2019 or COVID 19 6 xv Introduction to COVID 19 Living Textbook Chinese authorities tried to contain the outbreak by imposing quarantines social distancing and testing contact tracing and isolating infected people The entire Wuhan city of 11 million and Hubei Province of nearly 60 million and later a quar ter million people in other parts of China were put under lockdown 7 But global transportation systems having morphed over a period of 100 years from slow trick les of population from one place to another to instantaneous shifts between conti nents made it difficult to contain outbreaks of COVID 19 Forty years earlier the spread of HIV in the world had established how quickly a virus could spread between continents through simple air travel by an infected person In this century SARS MERS Zika and the Ebola virus outbreaks all demonstrated the ease with which travelers could spread emerging pathogens SAR CoV 2 is no different and it is even more efficient at transmission 8 In the first 3 4 months of the outbreak person to person transmission taking place before the infected person showed any symptoms of the disease undetected cases of COVID 19 infection accounted for 79 of documented infections 9 In less than two months SARS CoV 2 went from a public health emergency to a disease of pandemic status declared such on March 11 2020 by WHO 10 At that time there were 118 000 cases and 4291 deaths Over 90 of cases were in just four countries China 80 955 cases and 3162 deaths Italy 10 149 cases and 631 deaths Iran 8042 cases and 291 deaths and South Korea 7755 cases and 60 deaths 11 But the number of cases in countries kept increasing rapidly As SARS CoV 2 spread rapidly encountering a population that hand no immu nity and health care systems that were unprepared the virus claimed many lives Although less deadlier than SARS which had a case fatality rate of 10 and the influenza pandemic of 1917 that had a mortality risk of 2 COVID 19 appeared to be more deadly than seasonal influenza 0 1 mortality risk 12 Scientists estimated that the mortality risk for COVID 19 ranged from 0 2 to 1 0 and was to increase substantially for people aged 60 years and older 6 38 compared with those under 60 years 0 318 The highest case fatality rates were seen in people in their 70s 8 61 and 80s 13 4 years of age 13 However a number of other factors such as sex males chronic comorbidities such as diabetes obesity cardiovascular disease hypertension and other social determinants were emerging as risk factors for COVID 19 infection and mortality 14 15 As a new disease COVID 19 required an effective response to slow down spread and prevent health systems from becoming overwhelmed Countries implemented travel restrictions and full or partial lockdowns 16 which slowed down transmission but had devastating socioeconomic consequences and resulted in a global reces sion 17 Nonetheless it was evident that basic public health measures such as testing tracing isolating infected cases and quarantining others wearing facemasks and practicing good hand hygiene were important interventions for reducing transmis sion and mortality 18 Over the past 10 months promising new vaccines and a number of existing antiviral drugs and other treatments have emerged and are being used to manage the disease 19 21 Since its interspecies jump the global public health and medical communities have learned a lot about the virus An unprecedented amount of information has been xvi Introduction to COVID 19 Living Textbook published on COVID 19 with tens of thousands of papers being made available for free 22 The sheer deluge of publications makes it difficult to keep up with the scien tific literature and to assess the quality of publications given that many are in the form of preprints awaiting peer review process In the face of the flood of scholarly outputs the impetus for putting together an online textbook is to make available and easily accessible information that has been carefully curated and reviewed from the public domain in one place and to update it as new information comes forward The COVID 19 Living Textbook is prepared by 55 experts medical doctors social scientists and medical students who are experts in their field and many of them have been working on the frontline of the COVID 19 response It is aimed at a wide range of audiences including clinicians public health specialists social sci entists and the general public Twenty four chapters cover a range of topics that are divided into four sections Section 1 Chapters 1 2 3 and 4 introduce SARS CoV 2 and COVID 19 and include the timeline of events the virology and immunopathology transmis sion prevention and risk factors for COVID 19 and outpatient management of mild to moderate infection Section 2 Chapters 5 18 forming the bulk of the text focus on the system responses by the body to COVID 19 and clinical management in hospitals including in children and adolescents Chapter 15 Chapter 17 discusses the management of severe cases of COVID 19 and Chapter 18 given the limited available data examines postrecovery complications and long term impacts and compares it with the experience from SARS and MERS Section 3 Chapters 19 20 and 21 review the situation with personal protec tive equipment diagnostics and treatments and vaccines Section 4 The final three chapters Chapters 22 24 discuss the systemic dis crimination and inequalities that put certain groups at greater risk for the dis ease public policy making and leadership and planning for future epidemics and pandemics as new viruses that make the interspecies jump to humans and begin another evolutionary path in a new host family The COVID 19 pandemic and the global response to it has demonstrated that emerging and reemerging zoonotic diseases represent a public health challenge It further reminds the global community about the impact of inequality the gap between the haves and have not and the importance of social determinants of health Even in the largest economies of the world including the United States of America those groups with less opportunity including Blacks Hispanics and Native American have higher rates of mortality 23 The legacy of COVID 19 will have long lasting effects on society including on the delivery of medicine COVID 19 has ushered in and with great success telemedicine TM services 24 TM is being used to triage and treat basic illnesses monitor chronic diseases and diagnose mild cases of COVID 19 While the pandemic is an unfortu nate occurrence it provides an opportunity to set up an infrastructure to deliver health care to everyone in an equitable convenient and cost effective manner xvii Introduction

WHO Case fatality rate Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Coronavirus disease 2019 World Health Organization 1 1 Introduction The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV at the beginning of the 21st century signaled a warning of cross species transmis sions that had the potential to rapidly spread across the globe After SARS several other respiratory viruses influenza A strains of avian flu H5N1 H1N1 and H7N9 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS CoV spilled over from animal populations into humans Earlier the zoonotic transmis sion of viruses particularly coronaviruses that existed within bat populations was identified as a significant public health threat given the habitat loss climate change globalization and the uneven public health structure 1 Therefore it should not have been a big surprise when a third human coronavirus CoV causing COVID 19 emerged in December 2019 Although the virus emerged in China and spread rapidly around the world its health and economic consequences were far more complex The emergence of COVID 19 would turn into the greatest chal lenge facing global leaders since World War II 2 This chapter provides a short overview of COVID 19 contextualizing it within the family of coronaviruses cross species transmission and past pandemics 1 1 2 COVID 19 Outbreak to Pandemic Status The first cluster of patients presenting symptoms of fever cough myalgia and fatigue shortness of breath and pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan city Hubei province central China The majority of cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market where a variety of mammals were avail able for sale 3 The presentation of symptoms and patients association to a wet market pointed to infection of zoonotic origins similar to the SARS outbreak of 2002 and 2003 The authorities informed the local offices of the World Health Organization WHO on New Year s Eve and moved to close the mar ket the following day Retrospective analysis of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology as initially classified identified a 55 year old person with similar symptoms who had no links to the market with disease onset in mid November 4 In the early cases human to human transmission was speculated but not confirmed until two family clusters including one in which the hus band transmitted the disease to his disabled wife were identified in mid January Given the respiratory symptoms Chinese doctors quickly ruled out other com mon respiratory pathogens as well as SARS and the Middle East respiratory syn drome MERS coronaviruses responsible for the outbreak Samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from seven patients with severe pneumonia six were working at the market were sent to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for diagnosis of the causative pathogen On January 7 2020 it was confirmed that a novel coronavi rus with 80 nucleotide sequence similarity to the SARS coronavirus and 96 similarity with bat coronavirus 5 Five days later the full genome was globally shared a step that helped to facilitate the rapid development of diagnostic tests for the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019 n CoV and launched a search for multiple vaccines The 2019 novel coronavirus 2019 n CoV was renamed SARS CoV 26 and the resulting illness as the Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID 19 7 As cases began to exponentially increase it became evident that the virus was spreading quickly through human to human transmission probably since the middle of December and that the R0 was approximately 2 2 meaning that on average each patient had been spreading the infection to more than two other people 8 Researchers soon discovered that infected individuals could transmit the virus without showing any symptoms either when they were presymptomatic or in some cases asymptomatic never developing any symptoms of the disease 9 This posed a great challenge to containing COVID 19 In the case of SARS and MERS people were most infectious when they had symptoms The outbreak of COVID 19 also coincided with the Chinese Lunar New Year one of the most important holidays of the year when people return to their family homes Massive transmission had taken place as five million people many of whom might have been incubating the virus spread COVID 19 to other provinces in China and other countries Chinese authorities tried to contain the outbreak by blocking 2 Chapter 1 Overview of COVID 19 COVID 19 Outbreak to Pandemic Status most travel into and out Wuhan a city of 11 million by establishing a cordon sani taire on January 23 and later expanding it to other cities But cases had already started to pop up in several Asian countries Thailand reported its first case on January 13 Japan on January 15 and Korea on January 20 same day as the United States reported its first on the northwest coast and Hong Kong South Korea Japan and Taiwan on January 24 The United States reported its first case on January 20 on the northwest coast and on January 24 the first two European cases were confirmed in France 10 Within weeks a small cluster of cases from Wuhan had started to develop into a public health emergency of international concern with nearly 10 000 cases and 213 deaths at that time mostly in China 11 However by the end of January there were 106 cases in 19 countries The WHO Emergency Committee advised all gov ernments to put in place strong measures to test detect and isolate positive cases trace contacts ban large gatherings and promote social distancing Although SARS had a higher transmission rate R0 of around 312 and no vaccine or treatment the outbreak was successfully controlled by isolation of patients and infectious disease control measures But SARS CoV 2 was proving harder to contain because of its insidious mode of transmission where presymptomatic or asymptomatic could inadvertently pass on the virus to others The WHO advised countries to impose mitigation strategies and plan for health care needs as the epidemic unfolded Over the next 6 weeks the world witnessed an exponential rise in cases from the initial cluster in Wuhan to 118 000 infections and 4000 deaths even though largely in China but gradually spreading to 114 countries By March 11 COVID 19 cases would increase by 13 fold outside of China forcing the WHO Director General to officially declare a pandemic noting that We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear 13 With no effective treatments or vaccines and increasing numbers of infections outside China mathematical mod els of COVID 19 spread started to predict millions of deaths 14 15 The most high profiles of models the Imperial Model by Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London predicted 2 2 million deaths in the United States and 500 000 in the United Kingdom over the year if no actions were taken to slow down the outbreak Countries scrambled to promote hand hygiene and put into place nonpharmaceuti cal measures such as banning large gatherings closing schools and businesses and placing people under shelter at home orders easing the burden on health care systems by spreading out infected cases The goal of flattening the curve of COVID 19 became the defining graphic Figure 1 1 of the pandemic as it moved West As countries implemented lockdowns and near lockdowns aiming to slow down COVID 19 transmission adverse social psychological and economic conse quences began to emerge and disproportionately affected the poor and marginal communities see Chapter 22 The pandemic had massive fiscal consequences forcing governments to announce fiscal measures to protect businesses and peoples livelihoods 3 Figure 1 1

Coronaviruses Coronaviruses named after their spikey projections on their surface proteins resembling prongs of a crown or corona in Latin are enveloped nonsegmented single stranded positive sense RNA viruses Figure 1 2 The important structural proteins include spike S envelope E membrane M and nucleocapsid N They have a tendency for recombination and inherently high mutation rates com pared with DNA viruses which allows them to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches 17 There are four main subgroupings of coronaviruses alpha beta delta and gamma that are broadly distributed in mammals and birds and only alpha and beta are known to cause disease in humans These viruses cause respiratory enteric cardiovascular and neurological illnesses Seven coronaviruses with zoonotic ori gins from bats mice or domestic animals have been identified in humans Table 1 1 Four of the known coronaviruses 229E OC43 NL63 and HKU1 cause symptoms of the common cold and other respiratory related symptoms Two SARS and MERS coronaviruses are deadly in humans and the SARS CoV 2 is respon sible for the COVID 19 pandemic SARS was the first human coronavirus to elicit a massive public health response and had a major economic impact in several countries in Asia Emerging in Guangdong southern China in November 2002 it spreads to 26 countries infected 8096 persons and caused 774 deaths nearly 10 mortality rate 18 It was contained through strict quarantine of all infected people and their contacts and in some areas community level quarantine 19 By interrupting human to human transmission SARS disappeared by July 2003 leaving behind an indelible impression on coun tries in the region Ten years later a second coronavirus MERS CoV jumped from bats through its intermediary host dromedary camel in Saudi Arabia Although it remained limited to individuals from the Arabian peninsula or those who had recently returned from the Middle East 20 There was a major outbreak lasting 2 months in 2015 in

January 2020 the total num ber of confirmed cases was 2519 across 27 countries but the 85 cases were limited to Saudi Arabia The most recent coronavirus to make the interspecies jump is SARS CoV 2 Unlike SARS and MERS it is a more stealthy virus and can be spread by people who do not display any outward symptoms of the disease but are infectious and expelling virus droplets In some cases infected cases are presymptomatic and go on to develop symptoms a few days after exposure However an unknown number of infected people never develop any symptoms remaining asymptomatic who spread the virus discussed in Chapter 3 22 The actual number of infected cases who are asymptomatic ranges widely for COVID 19 On the Diamond Princess cruise ship 17 9 of cases were asymptom atic23 on the Mortimer Antarctica cruise ship 81 24 in Iceland 43 25 50 75 in the Italian village of Vo26 and an estimated 30 in South Korea based on a model 27 but 4 in an actual outbreak 28 The phenomenon of asymptomatic infections was observed in both SARS and MERS During the SARS outbreak in Singapore in 2003 7 5 of health care workers and 13 of cases in the general population were asymptomatic 29 In a retrospective data analysis of MERS an estimated 28 6 of cases were observed as asymptomatic bringing down the case fatality rate CFR 30 Because of asymptomatic cases of infection the CFR associated with COVID 19 has been difficult to measure and ranges widely from as high as 15 3 in France to as low as 0 1 in Singapore 31 It is suspected that COVID 19 mortality rate in the general population is greater than the common influenza virus 0 1 but far less than SARS and the death rate of 2 5 for the Spanish Flu of 1918 The risk of mor tality is higher for the elderly 60 years and over and increases with age those with comorbidities such as diabetes heart disease among others those who are immu nocompromised and for males SARS MERS and SARS CoV 2 exhibit a lot of common characteristics and demonstrate that they are not limited by geography and far more dangerous in an interconnected and densely populated world Table 1 2 1 4 Cross Species Transmission SARS CoV 2 and the other recent viruses such as HIV and Ebola virus that have jumped from nonhuman to human carriers are examples of species to species migra tion with the impact of a species virus on another species not well understood and they also have the potential to introduce evolutionary changes mutations during the jump that could have far more devastating downstream impacts A pathogen pyramid is useful for understanding successful interspecies virus transmission host switching and the emergence of new disease Figure 1 2 33 34 The framework has four levels that are crucial for understanding emerging infec tious diseases in humans The first level is the exposure of humans to new patho gens which requires contact between people and the host reservoir that can happen because of the changes in human

the ability to infect and cause disease in humans At the third level once the pathogen has estab lished its ability to infect humans it has to prove its capacity to transmit the disease to other humans The pathogens have to effectively exit the body through the upper respiratory tract lower gut urogenital tract skin or other fluids and infect another human In the final level of the pathogen pyramid the pathogen has adapted to the human host without the involvement of the original reservoir and can efficiently transmit such that a single index case is able to generate more than one secondary infection the R naught basic reproductive rate is greater than one Pathogens that have worked through these four levels become sufficiently transmissible to cause major outbreaks or to become endemic in human populations SARS CoV 2 has successfully gone through these four levels and exhibits a strong potential of becoming the fifth coronavirus to become endemic in humans What is notable about this coronavirus is that it has demonstrated successful host switching mechanisms along with effective human to human transmission through symptomless but infected cases Figure 1 3 Thus

occurred in 1918 and is instructive on a number of levels 36 During its brief run it infected 500 million people one third of the world s population and claimed an estimated 50 million lives Mortality was high in people younger than 5 years and those above 65 years and also among those between 20 and 40 years which was a unique fea ture of the pandemic Although the Spanish Flu did not originate in Spain and the first case was in the state of Kansas United States it was labeled such because Spain having remained neutral during the War had not imposed any censorship Newspapers were therefore free to report on the H1N1 influenza A virus with avian or swine origins The virus had multiple closely spaced pandemic waves between February 1918 and April 1920 37 The first wave beginning in March 1918 spreads across the world facilitated by overcrowding poor sanitation travel of people to cities in support of the War and soldiers traveling to battlefields and an immunologically naive popula tion In this first wave the disease was relatively mild with symptoms that included high fever and feeling tired lasting around 3 days but it disrupted the war efforts by causing significant numbers of soldiers to fall sick In August 1918 the virus mutated and the second wave of the disease left a far more deadly footprint In the mutated version death occurred within 24 h after disease onset The disease found a perfect transmission environment among soldiers returning home to their countries and bringing back a more virulent 8 Chapter 1 Overview of COVID 19 Past Pandemics and COVID 19 in the Context of History version that caused otherwise healthy patients basically drowning with their lungs saturated by pneumonia Later analysis showed that the deaths were not the result of the mutated virus but the patient s own immune reaction the cytokine explosion a protective measure by the body designed to promote healthy inflammation The Influenza Pandemic of 1918 1919 occurred at a time when the micro scopes did not have the ability to see a virus and very little was known about the microbiology of diseases It was understood that the human to human transmis sion took place through respiratory droplets There was no treatment no anti virals or antibiotics penicillin would not be discovered until 1928 and physicians used convalescent sera to reduce the risk of death Community miti gation strategies relied on nonpharmaceutical interventions including improved hygiene measures school closures bans on public gatherings wearing of face masks and isolation or quarantine orders 38 These measures helped to slow down the spread of the virus and by 1920 the pandemic was over and became a historical event The precautionary tale of the 1918 Influenza Pandemic contains a few lessons for the current COVID 19 pandemic which include Understanding transmission pathways and implementing measures for slow ing down and eliminating the virus Knowing the etiology and physiology critical for treating the disease Protecting the most at risk populations versus those that are relatively safe and recognizing that any measures described as exaggerated are probably insufficient The current COVID 19 pandemic is a sign of what the world can expect in the future Even if this current pandemic is not as deadly as the flu of 1918 1919 it will have long term impacts on health health services global economies social poli cies and politics It has already affected people s financial and job security and affected everyone at a deep sociological and psychological level But for all its uniqueness the pandemic is not likely to remain a one off and there may be next waves of pandemic diseases hitting the world There have already been reports of a new G4 virus genetically descended39 from the H1N1 swine flu with all the essen tial hallmarks of a candidate pandemic virus Given the immense variability of nature the fascinating ability of evolution in genetics and finally the almost unlimited number of viral populations waiting to cross from species to species one thing is clear there will be other viral attacks and these others will have more dramatic impacts on our population and could lead to far more devastating impacts on society The challenge for the global community and all of its health professionals is to ensure that all elements of international surveillance systems are enlisted and that health systems have the ability to quickly identify and classify the nature of the disease and to develop and enforce treatment and prevention models that protect the most vulnerable 9 References 1 Menachery VD Graham RL Baric RS Jumping species a mechanism for coronavi rus persistence and survival Curr Opin Virol 2017 23 1 7 https doi org 10 1016 j coviro 2017 01

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 other sys tems in addition to the respiratory system can be affected The disease is also unusual in that there is very low prevalence and almost no mortality in children but the severity of the disease and the risk of mortality appear to increase with age especially among those aged 70 years and older Furthermore the course of COVID 19 is in general more severe in those with underlying conditions or immunosuppressed This chapter addresses the immunopathology of SARS CoV 2 infection It discusses the structure of the virus presents an overview of the innate and adap tive immune system and describes the changes occurring in the bodies of COVID 19 patients particularly the dysregulation of the host immune system reflected by the cytokine storm This chapter provides an understanding of the immune system mechanisms that can help with the clinical management of COVID 19 cases 13 Envelope E protein m n 0 0 1 Spike S protein Membrane M protein Lipid bilayer envelope Nucleocapsid N protein and RNA genome Figure 2 1 Structure of SARS CoV 2 responsible for COVID 19 2 2 SARS CoV 2 Structure Coronaviruses have the largest genome of all RNA viruses and are classified within the order Nidovirales 1 The SARS CoV 2 is the seventh identified coronavirus and in the same beta coronavirus clade as SARS CoV and MERS CoV sharing almost 80 of the genome with SARS CoV 2 Similar to other coronaviruses SARS CoV 2 contains a single stranded RNA genome covered with a protein membrane and pro tein spikes S on its surface Figure 2 1 The S surface protein plays key roles in the viral life cycle and host defense response The glycoprotein of these protein spikes has a unique way of binding with the cell membrane protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE2 on the surface of host cells ACE2 host receptor is required for the host cell entry of SARS CoV 2 and their expression is not only restricted to the lungs but also to other systems in the human host 3 The entry of SARS CoV 2 requires conformational changes to the S protein The serine protease called furin cleaves the S protein and is essential for the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes and viral entry to the cell through endocytosis or nonendocytic cell surface entry 2 4 The S protein contains a S1 component a surface subunit that binds to the host cellular membrane and a S2 component a transmem brane subunit that allows for fusion Cleavage at different sites on the S protein not just increase fusion but also accelerate cell to cell spread Due to its critical role in infection furin is a possible target for therapeutic interventions 5 In the endocytic pathway potential targets of drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine the virion fuses with the vesicle and releases its single segmented RNA genome into the cytosol for immediate replication SARS CoV 2 infection activates innate and adaptive immune responses which are described in the next section 14 Chapter 2 Virology and the Immune System Response to COVID 19 The Immune System 2 3 The Immune System The body s response to SARS COV 2 has foundations deeply rooted in our immune system and thus a brief review of the basics is essential The immune system is complex and involves a network of players that interact with each other An invad ing pathogen triggers the innate immune response While many infections can be dealt through this innate system humans also have an additional layer of defense the adaptive immune system that actually adapts to protect against specific invaders Both aspects of the immune system are described below 2 3 1 Innate Immunity The first line of defense mechanism against foreign microorganisms in humans is mediated by the innate immune system The key cells in the inflammatory process include neutrophils macrophages dendritic cells and natural killer NK cells 6 These cells utilize mechanisms like cellular recognition proteins to identify foreign cells and remove them from the body Figure 2 2 PAMP or Pathogen Pathogen Toll Endocytic PRR IL 12 CD28 CD80 86 MHC II TCR Naive T cell Dendritic cell TH1 IFN cid 31 TH2 IL 4 IL 5 IL

C5 convertases C5b C8 Figure 2 3 Function of complement response in innate immunity Pattern recognition proteins PRRs are the essential component of innate immu nity Neutrophils and macrophages have protein receptors on their cell membranes that recognize certain patterns on foreign cells and not only recognize them as foreign but also differentiate them from host cells during elimination Examples of pathogen associated molecular patterns PAMPs are bacterial endotoxins in gram negative bacteria peptidoglycans lipoteichoic acid and viral double stranded RNA Figure 2 3 5 One of the most important and well st udied examples of PRRs is the comple ment system a series of circulating peptides that play a crucial role in innate host immunity A major component of this system the C1 protein recognizes antibodies bound to microbial proteins and initiates a downstream event known as the comple ment cascade 7 The result of this event is the production of C3b that leads to chemo taxis opsonization and phagocytosis of bacteria and to the formation of membrane attack complex Another type of PRR is the toll like receptor which is a transmem brane protein found on neutrophils and macrophages that binds PAMPs and results in the transcription of inflammatory genes leading to inflammation The key players of the innate immune system are the neutrophil macrophage and NK cells Neutrophils are directed to the sites of inflammation or infection by cytokines such as IL 8 and C3b proteins Macrophages serve a similar function but they respond somewhat slower than neutrophils NK cells contain similar protein receptors which are used to differentiate between host and infected injured cells Once recognized NK cells induce apoptosis NK cells are especially important in protection from viruses and tumor cells Other important components of the innate immune system are eosinophils basophils and mast cells An important point about the innate immunity system is that it does not contain memory cells or learned responses to a specific antigen The innate immune sys tem is general and nonspecific to inflammation Unlike the adaptive immune system that fine tunes and modifies itself to combat a specific infection injury over a longer period innate immunity is designed to respond immediately Innate immunity how ever is the preliminary process that is needed to generate the adaptive immune system 16 Chapter 2 Virology and the Immune System Response to COVID 19 The Immune System 2 3 2 Adaptive Immunity Unlike the innate immune system the adaptive immunity system is a more refined and calculated mechanism of host defense The mounted response of the adaptive immunity takes place over a longer period of time compared to the more generalized instantaneous response of the innate immune system This section will briefly dis cuss two types of Adaptive immune responses Humoral immunity and Cell mediated Immunity 2 3 2 1 Humoral immunity Humoral immunity is driven by B cells that secrete antibodies to protect the body from immediate and long term foreign microorganisms The cardinal event involves receptors on B cells binding to an antigen 3 This binding promotes activa tion and differentiation into more specialized cells The B cells consist of a B cell receptor which is made up of light and heavy immunoglobulin chains and B cell co receptor which is required for proper antigen binding Binding of antigens on multiple B cell receptors leads to a series of intracellular phosphorylation via the IP3 and diacylyglycerol DAG pathways intracellular signaling which results in the translocation of transcription factors to the nucleus and activation of B cells 8 B cells can now bind to thymus dependent and thymus independent antigens The classic examples of thymus independent antigens are the polysaccharides on capsular organisms such as H influenzae and S pneumonia which leads to our body mounting an antibody response This mechanism is also the basis for the unconjugated polysaccharide vaccinations These capsules contain sugar and are not suited for a more robust T cell mediated vaccine response However B cells are the ideal candidates for responding to these foreign pathogens Thymus dependent antigen leads to a specialization of B cells into assuming more specific roles Binding of these antigens primes T helper cells These T cells then activate B cells into secreting specific types of antibodies For example in the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid tissue binding of antigen carrying B cells to a Th2 cell and its co receptor leads to the release of IL 4 and IL 5 which signals B cells to secrete IgE IgE antibodies then protect against helminthic infections and mediated atopic diseases This process is called class switching and facilitated by somatic mutations in the heavy chain regions of immunoglobulins IgM antibody secreting generalized B cells differentiate into serving more specific roles This is a brief summary of how B cells work and the process is an arduous one Within the germinal centers of lymphoid tissue each individual B cell is faced with essential tasks for it to survive and proliferate These tasks include competing with other B cells for binding antigens processing the antigens and presenting them to T helper cells on their MHC II proteins that present exogenous antigens receiving stimulating signals from co receptors and then finally specializing Highly special ized and differentiated B cells can also circulate in the plasma as memory B cells where they remember the antigens they once interacted with and can class switch into secreting antibodies 17 Donor APC TH1 cell activation IL 12 TH1 cell CD28 Allogeneic peptide TCR CD40L C3aR or C5aR CD80 MHC Class II CD40 C3aR and C5aR C3 and C5 C3a and C5a Complement activation Figure 2 4 Activation of Th1 cells B cells also play a crucial role in innate immunity As we discussed above the complement system is a key component of the innate immunity 7 Antigen bound to Fab regions of IgG antibodies get cross linked to Fc regions of antibodies Essentially the antibody serves as a bridge for complement and antigen Once the bridge is formed complement can implement the recruitment of neutrophils and eventual phagocytosis of the microbe 2 3 2 2 Cell mediated immunity Cell mediated immunity is a vigorous system of host defense mechanisms that is designed to combat intracellular microbes such as viruses and mycobacteria along with tumor cells The same system is also the culprit behind many autoimmune con ditions T cells are the primary driver of cell mediated immunity Although there are several types of T cells CD4 and CD8 cells expressed by the cytotoxic T lym phocytes are important in measuring immunity of the patients Figure 2 4 6 CD8 cells are cytotoxic cells that have cytotoxic mechanisms against infected cells by which after binding it causes a fusion and release of granules that lead to cellular damage CD8 cells also express a Fas ligand that binds to CD 95 receptors on infected cells 6 The binding leads to apoptosis CD8 cells take things into their own hands and eliminate virally infected and tumor cells via apoptosis or involve ment of NK cells CD8 cells must be activated via antigen presentation through the MHC 1 class of cells Since all nucleated cells in the body express MHC 1 CD8 cells are ideal for eliminating cells that may be infected by viruses since any cells can present antigens to CD8 cells However before CD8 cells can acquire this ability they must be activated in lymphoid tissue with the help of CD4 cells and antigen presenting T cells CD4 cells are the helper T cells and are activated in lymph nodes when den dritic cells capture foreign antigens and present into T cells The binding of T cell 18 Chapter 2 Virology and the Immune System Response to COVID 19 Pathophysiology of SARS CoV 2 receptors with these antigen presenting cells must be accompanied with co signal binding with the CD 40L on CD 4 cells for the effect to take place It is also impor tant to mention that these antigens tend to be peptide based and also form the basis for peptide based vaccines like vaccines for diphtheria The interaction of CD 4 cells with antigen determines the fate of these T cells Cytokines or cellular messengers drive this differentiation Through events in the innate immunity IL 12 and interferon gamma are produced which induce CD 4 T cells conversion into Th1 cells 6 These cells then secrete more IL 12 and IFN gamma which promotes class switching of B cells into secreting IgG and also acti vates macrophages Macrophages are activated by the release of IL 12 and IFN gamma from Th 1 cells In other words it becomes a self regulating cycle Naive CD 4 cells get converted into Th 1 cells by certain cytokines Th 1 cells then secrete cytokines of their own which prepares a robust immune response resulting in a proinflammatory condition that plays an essential role in eradication of the virus A classic example of this pathway is our body s response to primary tuberculo sis As mentioned in the section for humoral immunity if naive CD 4 cells are met with other stimuli they can differentiate into Th 2 cells which play a role in atopy and protection against parasitic infections Other types of specialized helper T cells are regulatory T cells Th 17 cells and follicular helper T cells Cell mediated immunity also displays the phenomenon of memory cells Interactions with antigens induce changes in surface molecules and intracellular mechanisms which allows T cells to mount a more rapid and specialized response if exposed to the same antigen again In other words T cells remember antigens they once battled again and know exactly how to defeat them if they return This forms the basis of life long immunity and is the reason behind how vaccines work Although this discussion is brief a more detailed study of the immune system can be found in textbooks dedicated entirely to it These sections are a quick frame work review of how our body s defense systems work that can be quickly accessed and referenced when trying to make sense of our body s response to the SARS CoV 2 pathologies 2 4 Pathophysiology of SARS CoV 2 The virulence of SARS Cov 2 virus is attributed to its structural proteins that allow it to enter the human body and replicate Hence the genomic activity and replication are essential to its pathogenicity The SARS CoV 2 virus is a posi tive sense single stranded RNA virus with a 5 cap and 3 polyA tail 9 10 Transcription of the virus occurs between open reading frames ORFs found on the RNA Up to 6 ORFs can be present in a replication transcription complex RCT 11 The result of this transcription is a set of structural proteins envelope proteins spike proteins and nucleocapsids Frameshift mutations between these ORFs can lead to new and different types of proteins increasing the pathogenic ity Figure 2

HR2 TM CP 1 318 SP 1 18 Figure 2 5 Genomic structure of the SARS COV and MERS COV depicting the ORF regions found in the SARS COV Virus 9 2 4 1 Interaction between SARS CoV 2 and ACE2 The interaction between surface glycoprotein or spike protein on virions and human ACE2 enzymes starts the inflammatory process Of note is that the quantity of enzyme may be related to the extent of organ inflammation 8 12 For example ACE2 is found in the pulmonary capillaries and development of COVID 19 induced pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS is a common cause of mortality 13 The enterocytes and epithelia of the gastrointestinal tract also contain ACE2 and can be attributed to the gastrointestinal GI symptoms of SARS CoV 2 14 Though it is now known that the virion can cross the blood brain barrier neurological symptoms such as anosmia nausea and headaches are linked to the presence of ACE2 in the brain Another crucial organ system that is host to ACE2 enzymes is the myocardium High expression of the enzyme in the heart increases the chance of infection 12 It is possible that infection leads to thrombosis and vaso constriction of the vasculature in the myocardium Hence the incidence of throm bosis in intensive care unit ICU patients infected with COVID 19 is 31 15 2 4 2 Pathogenesis and Biochemistry SARS CoV 2 is structurally similar to the original SARS virus responsible for the 2002 2003 outbreak Studies have shown that both of these viruses share a similar spike glycoprotein structure in the receptor binding domain RBD that is respon sible for their affinity for the ACE2 Specifically the 3D structure of the spike pro tein on both of these viruses is identical Furthermore the amino acids in the whole 20 Chapter 2 Virology and the Immune System Response to COVID 19 Pathophysiology of SARS CoV 2 protein that comprise these RBDs are homologous in both of these viruses while also sharing 76 78 of the same amino acid sequences 10 explored this like ness The affinity between the RBD on viral cells to host ACE2 cells is crucial in pathogenicity The virion infects the cell by attaching its glycoprotein into host cell receptors leading to fusion and insertion of viral replication components into the host Molecular analysis of crystal structures containing RBD ACE2 complexes isolated from different hosts and identified certain amino acid residues on ACE2 that increased the affinity for binding with the viral glycoprotein 1 The RBD sequence on SARS COV 2 that interacts with the ACE2 is very similar to the origi nal SARS virus showcasing why SARS CoV 2 enters the human body through the ACE2 cells Furthermore the sequence also showed similar receptor binding motifs on the 2019 virus with high affinity for the amino acid residues on ACE2 cells In other words ACE2 is required for viral entry and further replication The surge of ICU cases and respiratory failure all over the country has demon strated that lung related mortality is a key feature of SARS COV 2 This interaction between the virions and the ACE2 is strongly linked to the severe ARDS and pneu monias We will discuss a few studies in the following section to better analyze the relationship between how viral protein binding with ACE2 receptors affects the respiratory system Figure 2 6 2 4 3 Pathophysiology of COVID 19 Related Organ System Involvement Understanding the role of ACE 2 and pathogenesis of SARS paves the way for explaining why SARS CoV 2 is so destructive to the lungs SARS COV 1 was sug gested to have an affinity for respiratory infection through ACE 2 in a 2005 study titled A crucial role of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 ACE2 in SARS coronavirus induced lung injur In their research Kuba et al infected two groups of mice with the SARS CoV 2 the control group wild type expressing ACE2 and an experimental group with ACE2 knocked out They later isolated a much smaller number of infectious viruses from the experimental group indicating a decreased lung pathogenicity 15 The study titled Single cell RNA expression profiling of ACE2 the putative receptor of Wuhan COVID 19 further analyzed the connection between COVID 19 and lung pathogenicity Zhao et al studied healthy pulmonary parenchyma from eight donors and found that ACE2 is expressed in 83 of type II alveolar epithelial cells Gene ontology analysis has revealed that these type II alveolar cells also con tain genes that somehow promote viral replication and ensure its survival Though evidence on this phenomenon is inconclusive 11 Introduction of viral particles and its life cycle in the large surface area of the lungs may be the reason behind cases of pneumonia ARDS and diffuse alveolar damage Parenchymal involvement causes acute lung injury and the release of pro inflammatory cytokines such as IL 8 TNF and IL 6 activating the innate immune system as discussed above and leading to the recruitment of neutrophils and 21 A Human coronavirus

the pulmonary capillary epithelium 13 Neutrophil mediated injury of the capillary epithelium leads to the leakage of fluids and protein to the alveoli causing a state of pulmonary edema Subsequent develop ment of ARDS becomes imminent causing an impairment of gas exchange and pulmonary compliance Depending on the severity of the inflammation oxygen ation and worse intubation may become a necessity This feared chain of events is often the culprit behind SARS CoV 2 associated mortality Examining evidence we can see that acute lung injury and ARDS progress rap idly One study examined 138 hospitalized patients for pneumonia of which 20 developed ARDS within 8 median days and 12 required mechanical ventilation A different study from Wuhan showed ARDS in 41 of hospitalized patients from pneumonia 15What exactly is causing the rapidly worsening respiratory failure One possible speculation can point towards the idea that the large surface area of 22 Chapter 2 Virology and the Immune System Response to COVID 19 Pathophysiology of SARS CoV 2 lungs with type II alveolar cells are invaded by the virus leading to immune response and subsequent development of ARDS Systemic hyperinflammation is another culprit that plays a role in progressively worsening ARDS and may play a role in SARS CoV 2 induced respiratory failure Studies have shown that early increase in pro inflammatory cytokines worsens the prognosis of ARDS and pneumonia 16 17 4 The lymphocytic infiltrates in the systemic inflammation deposit in the lungs and worsen the ARDS Historically the original SARS COV and MERS COV both demonstrated increased concentration of pro inflammatory cytokines such as IL 6 IL 12 and IFN gamma 7 Not surprisingly SARS CoV 2 has shown similar findings Furthermore the quantity of these pro inflammatory cytokines is higher in patients requiring intubation than in those who did not require mechanical ventilation Could cytokine induced inflammation be playing a role in this The information is cur rently still under scrutiny To complicate the discussion even more SARS CoV 2 patients have also shown elevated levels of TH 2 helper T cells which secrete IL 10 an anti inflammatory cytokine Therefore the role of cell mediated immunity is unclear in the pathophysiology of the infection Nonetheless an in depth explora tion of cytokine release syndrome is warranted Cytokine release syndrome CRS is a dysregulated pro inflammatory condition where a positive cycle of cytokine release is established leading to systemic shock and multisystem organ failure As a response to bacterial and viral infections the mecha nisms discussed in the immunology section allow cell messengers of the innate immu nity release cytokines that recruit monocytes and lymphocytes and reinforce the response to eradicate the infection In most scenarios especially SARS CoV 2 this response is sufficient to fight the infection and the host makes recovery However failure to eradicate the infection leads to a sustained inflammatory state where the cytokines exert a positive feedback on the immune cells which further secrete cyto kines thus creating a cycle The prolonged immune response then becomes detrimen tal to the host as systemic vasodilation develops leading to shock and organ failure To further this discussion we will include a hematologic perspective into under standing how coagulation plays a role into SARS CoV 2 related systemic inflam mation It is well understood that inflammation can activate the coagulation cascade by several mechanics down regulation of antithrombin III and other anticoagulant mechanisms tissue factor mediated thrombin generation and impaired fibrinolysis Thrombin itself is known to induce IL 6 and IL 8 in endothelial cells which plays a role in the sustenance of inflammation Furthermore the endothelial injury induced by pro inflammatory cytokines worsens the coagulation balance This may be the possible basis for cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC a condition in which blood clots form throughout the body and thrombosis seen in severe COVID 19 patients In the study titled Abnormal coagulation parameters are associated with poor prognosis in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia it was found that a large majority of non survivors met signs of DIC and had significantly higher D dimer levels Fibrin degradation products and elevated PT PTT It is thus essential to realize that systemic inflammation and the coagulation system in combina tion can play a crucial role in overall mortality associated with SARS COV 2 23 References 1 Masters PS The molecular biology of coronaviruses Adv Virus Res 2006 66 193 292 https doi org 10 1016 S0065 3527 06 66005 3 2 Zumla A Chan J Azhar

Robin Chakraborty CHAPTER 03 List of Abbreviations BMI NPI SARS CoV 2 SSE TB Body mass index Nonpharmaceutical public health intervention Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus Super spreader event Tuberculosis 3 1 Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV 2 is a respiratory virus that spreads from person to person through close contact and causes COVID 19 It is highly contagious Infected individuals who show no symptoms can transmit the virus without knowing they are infectious making it difficult to control community spread Although all age groups can be infected those over 60 years old specifically males and those with underlying chronic conditions such as diabetes pulmonary or heart disease obesity or in an immunocompromised state are at higher risk Until there is a vaccine COVID 19 prevention will depend on traditional epidemic con trol measures This chapter summarizes the latest information on what is known about COVID 19 transmission prevention and risk factors 3 2 Viral Transmission Previous studies of SARS CoV indicated a significant role of airborne transmission with the virus remaining infectious in aerosol for hours and on surfaces for up to 2 days 1 Considering that the genome of SARS CoV 2 is similar to SARS CoV the transmission behavior is also more similar Studies have shown that infected indi viduals can transmit SARS CoV 2 through large droplets 5 10 m 2 and more 25 recently through aerosol 5 m 3 exhaled during breathing speaking coughing sneezing or yelling The case study of COVID 19 infections on the cruise ship Diamond Princess demonstrated that aerosol transmission contributed to disease progression The virus is more easily spread in indoor or enclosed environments that have poor or inadequate ventilation Viral transmission can also occur through direct contact with an infected person or indirect contact through hand mediated transfer from contaminated surfaces and objects to the mouth nose or eyes The virus has been detected in various bodily fluids and in feces but so far there is no evidence of its transmission through these modalities has been found It is recommended that strict precautions should be taken in hospital settings 4 Person to person transmission is also dependent on the infectiousness of cases which is based on the viral load The viral load is defined as the concentration of viral particles in the biological medium of transmission The higher the viral load then it is more likely an infected person will transmit the virus to others In the case of COVID 19 the viral load is related to the time course of the illness 5 The incubation period which is the time between exposure to the virus and symptom onset for COVID 19 is 4 5 days and in some cases it can be up to 14 days In Figure 3 1 the y axis represents the viral load and the x axis represents the days after symptom onset with the first day of symptoms designated as 0 During this time the viral load gradually rises peaking about 2 3 days prior to the onset of symptoms In mild cases the viral load sharply declines over the course of 7 days such that by the fourth to seventh day of symptomatic infection the patient becomes much less likely to infect others 6 In more severe cases the viral load begins to decline after the second week 7 But prolonged viral shedding has been reported for up to 63 days in nasopharyngeal swabs among adult patients 8 Figure 3 1 Viral load density of COVID 19 5 y t i s n e D 30 20 10 0 26 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Days after symptom onset Chapter 3 Transmission Prevention and Risk Factors of COVID 19 Reproductive Rate and Dispersion In terms of transmission few concerns are the presymptomatic or asymptomatic cases transmitting the disease few days before the onset of symptoms when the viral load is highest without being aware that they are infecting others 9 The role of asymptomatic cases in transmission while reported has been difficult to quantify 10 But the risk of transmission from presymptomatic cases is high and according to some reports contributed to 48 and 62 of transmissions in Singapore and China 11 It is safe to assume that a significant proportion of secondary transmission is occurring before the onset of illness and in some instances in the absence of symptoms A comparison of SARS CoV 2 to SARS displays the immense power of trans missibility of this virus since it can be spread by presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals through airborne transmission and requires greater individual and com munity vigilance In contrast SARS differed in the sense that affected patients became symptomatic soon after infection and could be easily isolated As a result SARS was successfully contained using old style public health measures such as isolation and quarantine 3 3 Reproductive Rate and Dispersion R naught R0 is an important epidemiological concept for understanding disease transmission defined as the average number of new cases generated by every infected case 12 It is not a fixed value and depends on a variety of factors such as the host s population susceptibility to infection demographics socioeconomic situa tion and seasonaility R0 is a useful public health measure in terms of disease spread and its eventual containment Typically the R0 value varies between less than 1 if the disease is controlled and greater than 1 if it is spreading Throughout the course of an outbreak of disease interventions aimed at controlling the spread can be described as attempts to lower the value of R0 The average R0 of COVID 19 is estimated at the range between 2 2 and 2 7 with a doubling time of cases in 6 7 days 13 Since R0 is an average value its meaning can be obscured by a highly dispersed distribution where a handful of infected people are causing most of the secondary transmission The dispersion factor k describes how much a disease clusters through super spreader events SSE A small dispersion factor means that a rela tively small number of cases are responsible for transmission while a larger k indi cates that transmission is more evenly spread In the case of COVID 19 a small fraction 10 of infected individuals is esti mated to be causing 80 of the secondary infections through SSE 14 In many instances a single infected person transmits the virus to a large number of people while attending large gathering such as meetings conferences religious services sporting events or other social get togethers Large disease clusters have occurred in meetings nursing homes churches prisons food processing plants and on 27 ships 15 Two other factors affecting clusters of disease outbreak are time and physi cal space The longer the period of exposure the group staying together the likeli hood of viral spread is greater Indoor and poorly ventilated spaces are especially conducive to transmission In one study from Japan the odds of transmission in a closed environment were estimated to be 18 7 times greater compared to an open air environment 16 3 4 Assessing Risk of Transmission Understanding the risk of infection is important for beating back the virus and pro fessor Erin Bromage17 from the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth has devel oped an easy formula Successful Infection Exposure to Virus Volume Exposure Time Table 3 1 Some places of high risk usually will have high volumes of viral particles or low volumes of virus but require extended exposure A massive out break was reported in a German slaughterhouse where the virus spreads up to 8 m 26 ft through the ventilation air cooling system infecting 1500 out of 7000 employees 18 The Texas Medical Association has also developed a risk chart for COVID 19 Figure 3 2 19 3 5 Individual Disease Prevention As an airborne virus SARS CoV 2 spreads very easily as demonstrated by a fluid dynamic professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who showed that a turbulent gas cloud created by a cough could reach up to 7 8 m 23 27 ft 20 In combination with the improved hygiene measures such as regular handwashing and coughing into the elbows it is also very important to wear facemasks and physically distance from other people The World Health Organization WHO has defined Table 3 1 Risk of Transmission Time and Volume of Virus Low Volume High Volume Long time Work place Cruise ship Shopping malls Amusement parks Restaurants bars Weddings funerals birthdays Concerts Meetings Sports events Meat packing plants Prisons Assisted living housing Short time Safe Supermarket Outdoors jogging walking Public toilets Choir practice Gyms 28 Chapter 3 Transmission Prevention and Risk Factors of COVID 19 Individual Disease Prevention Figure 3 2 Risk of COVID 19 infection in a variety of situations close contact as being within 1 m 3 ft of a COVID 19 infected person for more than 15 min while not wearing a mask 21 In such instances the recommendation is to quarantine for 14 days regularly take temperature and monitor symptoms and to keep a safe distance for other members of the household The use of facemasks is 29 recommended during isolation procedures Only after 14 days or 10 days after the onset of symptoms and two negative tests can a patient come out of quarantine once the symptoms have been cleared 22 In addition to preventative measures such as handwashing coughing into the elbows wearing a mask keeping a distance of 6 ft apart from others outside the home and avoiding large gatherings there are other steps that should be taken to keep the immune system strong These include the following Eating a well rounded and balanced diet that includes whole grains fruits vegetables beans nuts and legumes Some studies have indicated that Vitamin D23 and zinc24 may reduce the risk of COVID 19 but these protec tions are not definitive Exercising regularly as it confers a range of benefits including reducing stress and improving cardiorespiratory fitness 25 The United States Centers for Disease Control CDC recommends 30 min of moderate intensity aerobic exercise 5 days a week for adults and 60 min of exercise daily for children and adolescents 26 Refraining from smoking27 as it is associated with increased severity of dis ease and deaths in hospitalized patients Refraining from alcohol use as it has been shown to increase the likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome and liver damage 28 A study from Wuhan reported that 53 of patients with COVID 19 experienced liver damage as consequences of the infection 29 Sleeping for at least 8 h which is an essential component for stronger immunity The WHO publishes updated guidelines and posters for downloading on how to protect yourself and others against COVID 19 which is accessible at https www who int emergencies diseases novel coronavirus 2019 advice for public Cleaning hands with soap or alcohol based sanitizers is the most effective way to kill the virus 3 6 Community Prevention Nonpharmaceutical Interventions In situations where vaccines and antiviral agents are insufficient or unavailable the WHO recommended introducing nonpharmaceutical public health interventions NPIs to contain infection delay spread and reduce the impact of pandemic dis eases 30 31 The NPIs are considered outside of health care settings and focus on measures that 1 limit international spread of the virus e g travel screening and restrictions 2 reduce spread within national and local populations e g testing isolation and treatment of positive cases monitoring and quarantining of exposed persons and introducing social distancing measures 3 reduce an individual per son s risk of infection and 4 communicate risk to the public 30 Chapter 3 Transmission Prevention and Risk Factors of COVID 19 Community Prevention Nonpharmaceutical Interventions In addition to testing and isolating positive cases contact tracing and quarantine measures governments are recommended to introduce NPI measures to control the spread of infection Nonpharmaceutical interventions include and are not limited to the following 1 Universal masking mandate in public areas 2 Maintaining safe distances between people in public spaces 3 Banning public events and large gatherings that generate crowds including personal responsibility to limit social gatherings 4 Closing schools and universities 5 Closing nonessential businesses 6 Stay at home orders For COVID 19 countries around the world implemented aggressive public health measures to control viral spread Some countries were successful in bringing down the R0 including China where the coronavirus originated A study32 of the outbreak in Wuhan the epicenter of the virus measured the attack rate without any interventions and after public health interventions were imposed found that the viral attack rate dropped precipitously Table 3 2 The interventions were estimated to prevent 94 5 of infections Although the outbreak started in early December no strong interventions were implemented until January 20 when human to human transmission was confirmed On January 23 the government imposed an unprecedented policy of cordon sani taire effectively cutting off the city and Hubei province from the rest of the world but new cases continued to overwhelm hospitals that faced shortages in supply and were understaffed The rate of viral infection among health care workers was high probably due to lower awareness of nosocomial infections The authors observed that asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases could be a substantial challenge to epidemic control and the use of traditional NPI measures and policies were neces sary to control the COVID 19 outbreak Table 3 2 Rate of Viral Transmissibility in Wuhan Before and After Implementing NPI Measures32 Period

outbreak and moved quickly to test and quarantine suspected cases trace potential cases ban large gatherings impose social distancing and enforce universal masking measures and instruct people to stay 1 5 m apart 33 34 They prepared hospitals and staff and communicated accurate up to date information to the public As COVID 19 moved westwards with Europe becoming the next epicenter countries implemented NPI measures The NPI measures for 11 countries were introduced successively from March 2 to March 20 and had a substantial effect on reducing transmission 81 reduction in attack rate and brought R0 below 1 probability Rt 1 is 99 9 35 The blanket measures to contain a pandemic can come at very high social and economic costs but they may be necessary to break the chain of disease transmis sion In the case of COVID 19 it was necessary to mitigate the worst effects of the disease such as the overwhelming surge in demand for hospital care particularly intensive care and the high levels of mortality 3 7 Risk Factors COVID 19 can affect people of all ages and backgrounds but the data suggest that some people are more likely than others to get sick if they are exposed to the virus From the outset of the epidemic the data from China showed more severe illness and higher rates of infection in older groups and those with preexisting comorbid conditions 36 Age is an independent risk factor for older people that had no underly ing conditions and also being at increased risk of severe illness For example people in their 60s are at higher risk for severe illness than people in their 50s and those in their 50s are at higher risk than those in their 40s The greatest risk for severe illness is among those aged 80 years or older Children under 10 are not at risk and less likely to spread the disease However children between ages 10 and 19 are at less risk of severe illness but just as likely as adults to spread the disease 37 The Lancet Global Health recently estimated that one in five individuals world wide are at increased risk of severe disease should they become infected due to an underlying comorbidity and that risk varies considerably with age 38 The prevalence of one or more comorbidities is approximately 10 by 25 years 33 by 50 years and 66 by 70 years The case fatality rate among those with preexisting comorbid conditions was 10 5 for cardiovascular disease 7 3 for diabetes 6 3 for chronic respiratory diseases 6 0 for hypertension and 5 6 for cancer Males were also at twice the risk compared with females Obesity classified as a body mass index BMI of 30 or above and severe obesity of BMI of 40 is emerging as an important risk factor in the United States where the prevalence is 40 compared with 24 in Spain 20 in Italy and 6 2 in China 39 Obese people with COVID 19 are more likely to experience severe pneumonia and require ventilation 40 41 People who are in an immunocompromised state because of organ transplants or chemotherapy for cancers are also vulnerable to COVID 19 One study that 32 Chapter 3 Transmission Prevention and Risk Factors of COVID 19 Conclusion considered COVID 19 in immunocompromised patients reported high case of fatal ity rate which was estimated to be 21 4 42 Such a situation presents a conundrum for doctors who need to balance the risk of delaying chemotherapy against the increased risk of infection during the pandemic It has been speculated that diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis TB which lead to immunocompromised states are also a risk factor for COVD 19 infection but at this time there is no enough evidence for a definitive association In China TB was the most common comorbidity in COVID 19 patients with 36 concurrently having a TB infection compared to a general prevalence of 25 in the general population 43 Furthermore patients with TB who contracted COVID 19 progressed to severe symptoms much more quickly than those without TB with the time from symptom onset to severe pneumonia averaging 3 days compared to 7 8 days in cases without TB For people living with HIV the risk associated with COVID 19 is inconclusive and most likely obscured by treatment with antiretrovirals 37 In Barcelona 1 of COVID 19 patients who required hospitalization were HIV posi tive which is much higher than the HIV prevalence of 0 3 in the population 44 Smoking is associated with a high risk of severe symptoms for COVID 19 and a study published by the International Society for the Prevention of Tobacco Induced Diseases found that smokers infected with COVID 19 were 1 4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms and 2 4 times more likely to be admitted to the ICU to COVID 19 patients who were require nonsmokers 45 intubation or die compared Other groups who need extra precaution are people in closed settings such as prisons homeless shelters homes for people with disabilities and developmental or behavioral disorders refugee camps food processing plants and other manufactur ing settings 3 8 Conclusion In summary SARS CoV 2 is highly transmissible and can be identified in droplets aero sols and on surfaces before the onset of symptoms A person can be infec tious for up to 14 days or longer Transmission from presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases makes it diffi cult to contain the spread of disease and it is therefore recommended that individuals observe good hand hygiene wear masks and keep a physical dis tance of 1 5 m 6 ft from others The risk of transmission varies by settings but a closed environment with poor ventilation large crowds and prolonged contact with an infected person increase the likelihood of secondary infection Child to adult transmission appears uncommon and children do not seem to be at risk for COVID 19 unless there are comorbidities 33 Increasing age and underlying comorbidities increase the risk of severe illness and mortality In the absence of a vaccine or effective treatment the immune response should be strengthened through a healthy diet regular exercise and at least 8 hours of sleep References 1 Doremalen N Morris DH Holbrook MG et al Aerosol and surface stability of SARS CoV 2

04 List of Abbreviations ACAAI ACE II ATII ROS WHO American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology Angiotensin converting enzyme II Angiotensin II Reactive oxygen species World Health Organization 4 1 Introduction Symptoms of COVID 19 can range from an asymptomatic course to a myriad of manifestations Most people will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness symptoms The World Health Organization WHO reports that 80 of infections are mild or asymptomatic 15 of infections are severe which require oxygen and 5 of infections are critical requiring ventilation For patients with a mild clinical course the most common symptoms are flu like ie fever dry cough shortness of breath difficulty breathing fatigue sore throat chills and muscle pain A subset of patients with initially mild symptoms may experience a rapid worsening of their condition requiring hospitalization This chapter discusses the current management strategies for mild to moderate disease that doesn t require hospitalization and can be handled at home 4 2 COVID 19 Overview of Symptoms The virus has an incubation period of 2 14 days on average patients report symp toms within 3 5 days 1 The time from infection to symptom manifestation appears to be based on the immune system functioning of the individual Older adults aged 37 70 years having shorter incubation periods and more severe disease courses Those under 18 years of age are less likely to present with the hallmark symptoms of fever and cough compared to adults aged 18 64 2 CDC reports that 83 99 of COVID patients experience fever 59 82 cough 44 70 fatigue 40 84 anorexia 31 40 shortness of breath 28 33 sputum production and 11 35 myalgia 3 A study of 1099 patients across 552 hospitals in China found that over 75 of cases reported a fever ranging between 37 5 C and 39 0 C 99 5 F 102 2 F 68 7 reported a cough 38 1 fatigue and 33 7 spu tum production 4 The same study found that comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes could influence the severity of disease progression Table 4 1 also provides information for the findings of other coexisting disorders 4 3 Current Management Strategies for Mild Disease It is currently recommended that those with mild symptoms or previous exposure to the virus stay home For most patients the disease is self limited and does not require medical care To manage symptoms the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends rest staying hydrated and the use of over the counter medicines like acetaminophen 5 Infected persons living in a household with others should take extra precautions to avoid the spread of the virus The most important prophylaxis is frequent hand washing or the use of an alcohol based hand sanitizer if handwashing is not possi ble It is also recommended for all individuals to not touch their face especially their nose eyes and mouth this precautionary step decreases the risk of viral entry into the body To protect others living in the household from becoming infected CDC recommends a frequent sanitization of shared surfaces isolation and social distancing of the infected person from the rest of the household including pets and the infected person wearing a mask when around others If possible the infected person should even have his or her own separate bathroom for the duration of ill ness Patients who use CPAP continuous positive airway pressure or BiPAP bilevel positive airway pressure machines and nebulized medications should not use them when other people are around as it can become aerosolized The WHO updated the criteria for discharge from isolation as part of the clinical care pathway of a COVID 19 patient These criteria apply to all COVID 19 cases regardless of isolation location or disease severity The criteria for discharging patients from isolation i e discontinuing transmission based precautions without requiring retesting For symptomatic patients 10 days after symptom onset plus at least three additional days without symptoms including without fever and without respi ratory symptoms and For asymptomatic cases 10 days after positive test for SARS CoV 2 38 Chapter 4 Outpatient Management Mild

with COVID 19 Infection In general patients with comorbidities are not more likely to get infected with COVID 19 compared to the general population People with the underlying chronic conditions such as diabetes obesity HIV other immunocompromised states and hypertension are more likely to suffer from complications when infected with the virus For patients with comorbidities recommendations may vary and will be pro vided by the health care practitioner but general guidance is as follows Respiratory disease Patients with asthma are advised to follow the general precautions listed above as well as to continue the established asthma action plan The American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology ACAAI issued a statement to encourage adherence to allergy and asthma maintenance regimens According to the ACAAI there is no evidence that intranasal or inhaled corticosteroids increase the risk of getting the COVID 19 infection or lead to a worse outcome if someone does get infected 6 Cardiovascular conditions Older patients with cardiovascular comorbidities may have an added protection against severe disease from the virus if on angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ARBs according to an observational study conducted by United Health Group and the Yale University School of Medicine 7 A meta analysis also found that ACE inhibitors ARBs do not increase the risk of infection nor developing severe disease 8 Diabetes Patients who have diabetes must maintain blood glucose level as infection with COVID 19 can lead to increased complications this is because high blood glucose levels can suppress the immune system These complica tions can come in the form of kidney failure and diabetic ketoacidosis which are both life threatening and require immediate medical attention 4 Diabetic patients must continue to take prescribed medications in addition to avoiding the risk factors for the development of COVID 19 Immunocompromised People that are immunocompromised are at an increased risk of developing infections because the immune system is the body s defense against pathogens Immunocompromised individuals include but are not lim ited to patients with cancer transplants and HIV These patients should con tinue with their normal treatment regimen for their underlying disease even if it involves immunosuppressants If a patient develops a fever of 100 4 F 38 C or higher he she must call their physician immediately 9 Obesity An often underestimated comorbidity that many Americans face is obesity It is reported that 42 of adults are obese and 9 are severely obese 10 Obesity is associated with decreased expiratory reserve volume functional capacity and respiratory system compliance It is also associated with increased inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the increased morbidity asso ciated with obesity in COVID 19 infections 5 For these reasons patients suffer ing from obesity should work with their health care practitioner to develop a lifestyle plan that includes diet modification and frequent exercise 11 43 4 3 2 Protective Health Measures Quality sleep preferably of 7 8 h in duration exercise and a well balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables help to bolster the innate immune system The innate immune system is our body s first line of defense against a variety of pathogens before our adaptive immune system can offer additional and stronger protection It takes about 4 7 days for the adaptive immune response to set in therefore in the initial stages of infection the innate immune response is essential for fighting and clearing the virus see Chapter 2 Vitamins and supplements such as zinc and Vitamin C while not officially rec ognized as treatments for mild symptoms can possibly be cheap low risk and efficacious prophylaxis because of their immune modulating effects on the immune system Studies have shown that zinc can inhibit the replication of some viruses such as the original coronavirus and arterivirus thus decreasing the severity of dis ease 1 Part of how COVID 19 causes disease is by blocking the angiotensin convert ing enzyme II ACE II receptor resulting in increased levels of angiotensin II ATII and decreased levels of angiotensin 1 7 AT 1 7 Both of these changes lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species ROS like superoxides which cause endothelial cell dysfunction this state predisposes the patient to thrombosis in organs like lungs and as a result impairing oxygen delivery 12 Vitamin C is a well known antioxidant and can potentially protect against the effect of ROS thus decreasing the severity of disease and the chance of developing serious complica tions from the virus A 2017 study found that daily or weekly vitamin D supplemen tation was protective against acute respiratory tract infection 5 which can make this a helpful prophylaxis against COVID 19 Home oxygen therapy can be considered effective in patients with mild hypoxia with improvement in saturation with oxygen by nasal cannula who can reliably adhere with therapy and follow up Such patients will require daily televisits Thromboprophylaxis at home can be considered in patients at high risk for thrombosis Fructose consumption obesity and sedentary lifestyle all contribute to chronic systemic inflammation which results in poor immune function and can render a person more susceptible to developing disease and or slow recovery complications from the disease 13 4 4 Management by Telemedicine Telemedicine is a method that allows health care practitioners to provide care to patients through electronic means It is preferable in most of the outpatient manage ment of COVID 19 patients as it can prevent avoidable in person medical visits to medical offices urgent care centers or emergency rooms ERs providing relief to a strained health care system and preventing unnecessary use of personal protective equipment PPE For the general public the advantage of this service is that patients 44 Chapter 4 Outpatient Management Mild and Moderate Symptoms of COVID 19 Management by Telemedicine have an increased access to care in an environment that is most convenient and comfortable to them In the long term this can promote adherence to treatment plans and decrease loss to follow up rates For those that lack adequate health insurance telemedicine is not only cheaper compared to in person office visits but can even be free in some cases In his Washington Post article primary care physician Michael Barnett writes Much of the actual work of primary care happens when patients aren t in the office whether doctors are coordinating with three specialists to tweak a complex medication regimen or finding a hospice agency for an ailing patient The only reason we deliver almost all primary care through office visits is because that is what insurers will pay for 14 For COVID 19 patients with mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization telemedicine is a great option to provide care while reducing the risk of transmission to the vulnerable public who rely on in person clinic visits Patients who are considered stable enough to be managed at home are risk stratified into low moderate and high risk to determine the frequency of fol low up visits A large part of telemedicine is a conversation between the health care provider and the patient Most health care practitioners prefer to conduct telemedicine ser vices such as physical examinations physical therapy and mental health services through video chat or telephone conversation This allows the health care practitio ner to observe the general appearance of the patient and their ability to perform tasks the provider guides them Providers can take patient vitals by calculating respiratory rate based on observation and providing equipment for patients to moni tor their own health such as electronic blood pressure machines and blood glucose monitors During video televisits clinicians can judge the level of dyspnea oxygen saturation and mental status by observation and can inquire about other symptoms such as orthostasis dizziness falls changes in sensation of smell and taste hypo tension and urine output Based on the examination the provider can then recom mend tests or treatments that can be delivered to a patient from a pharmacy near them or if in person evaluation is necessary In a New York Times article Dr Emil Baccash a geriatrician in Brooklyn N Y said of telemedicine Telemedicine is not a substitute for seeing and physically examining a patient But there are some patients especially elderly patients who can t get out of the house I can talk to them and look at their problem on my computer take a snapshot say of a leg infec tion and enter it directly into their medical record If a blood test is needed I can have a lab technician come to their house 15 Patients who are less reliable to self monitor and report may need more intense follow up to continue the management at home Telemedicine also offers a health care practitioner the opportunity to observe a patient s living environment Environment can exacerbate certain conditions or pre dispose certain demographics like the elderly to injury Rural communities can also benefit from telemedicine as many members of this community have trouble with accessing care due to the deficit of health care centers and the distance to these sites 45 References 1 Symptoms of Coronavirus Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2020 https www

respiratory system has become very well recog nized since this novel coronavirus has been established The rapid spread of COVID 19 along with its burden on the respiratory system has pressured health care systems into managing the health status of patients It is important to compre hensively understand how COVID 19 manifests in order to overcome this pandemic in a globally resource limited climate This chapter summarizes the pathophysiol ogy symptoms and associations with other respiratory diagnoses as well as clini cal management 47 5 2 Origins Transmission and Pathogenesis of COVID 19 Disease In December 2019 there was an outbreak of an unknown virus at a seafood market in Wuhan China initially it was referred to as pneumonia of unknown origin It was thought that the transmission was zoonotic and only the people working in the seafood market were affected However human to human transmission was later established 1 World Health Organization WHO declared a public health emer gency of international concern on January 30 2020 and pandemic on March 30 2020 2 The novel coronavirus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 SARS CoV 2 following on from SARS CoV which caused acute respira tory distress syndrome ARDS and resulted in high mortality during 2002 2003 Coronaviruses are a family of enveloped positive single stranded RNA viruses that are classified within the Coronavirus family and Nidovirales order 3 The predominant mode of transmission is from respiratory droplet spread by coughing sneezing and talking which can easily contaminate surfaces and spread the virus within the households 4 There is an evidence for the spread by a direct contact with infected secretions or large and small aerosol droplets Figure 5 1 Immunity develops soon after infection but wanes gradually over time It is unknown if reinfection is common High risk populations include children pregnant women immunocompromised patients health care providers and elderly people Incubation period can extend up to 14 days from the onset of exposure Some individuals can be asymptomatic or may have mild severity of fever shortness of breath and cough due to a good immune system Most COVID 19 patients had mild symptoms in the early onset of disease how ever the condition of some patients declined in the latter half of the disease or dur ing the recovery phase The mortality of many patients is attributed to the rapid development of ARDS and multiorgan failure as a result of a cytokine storm An effective suppression of the cytokine storm is a pivotal way to prevent the deteriora tion of patients with COVID 19 infection and save the patients lives 5 3 Pathophysiology The complexity of a cytokine storm s pathogenesis involves the loss of regulatory control of pro inflammatory cytokine production both locally and systemically thereby causing excessive immune responses with potential immune damage to the human body 5 The cytokine storm is detailed in Figure 5 2 Increased serum levels of IL 2R and IL 6 in patients with COVID 19 are associ ated with an increased severity of disease Moreover other studies have found patients in the intensive care unit ICU displaying increased serum levels of granu locyte colony stimulating factor IP 10 MCP 1 macrophage inflammatory 48 Chapter 5 Pulmonary Manifestations of COVID 19 Pathophysiology Mucus within eyes ears nose and mouth are in direct contact with respiratory droplets or indirect contact from live particles on contaminated inanimate objects called fomites door knob surface clothing Entry of virus in respiratory tract attacking type 2 pneumocyte in alveoli which affects production of surfactant and thus alveoli collapse Virus adheres to and mimics ACE2 receptor in alveoli gaining access into cell ssRNA disassemble and release viral RNA which attaches ribosomes use for translation of proteins into polyprotein in presence of RNA dependent RNA polymerase virus allowing conversion of ssRNA into ssRNA Small viral proteins in endoplasmic reticulum are arranged and transported to golgi apparatus where virus is packaged out of the cells as new progeny of viral cells Through exocytosis virus progeny are released out of the cells In the process of replicating the virus there is damage to the alveoli Hence signals are released in the form of inflammatory cytokines such as interferons interleukin 6 Alveolar macrophages detect the cell injury and release IL 6 IL 1 IL 8 TNF cid 31 chemokines This inflammatory process in lung parenchyma stimulates the nerve fibers and produces a cough reflex TNF cid 31 IL 6 IL 8 increase the vascular permeability and increase adhesion molecule which causes leakage of fluid in interstitium alveoli and lung parenchyma causing interstitial edema and pulmonary edema Dyspnea and hypoxia Neutrophils try to engulf the virus and there is a release of toxins and chemokines further damaging alveolar cells Thus the production of surfactant decreases leading to alveolar collapse and eventually hypoxia Figure 5 1 Flowchart describing the pathogenesis of COVID 19 protein 1A and tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF compared to COVID 19 patients from general wards 6 Therefore this suggests that the cytokine storm is positively correlated with disease severity Given that cytokine storms involve hyperinflammation immunosuppression is likely to be beneficial 5 The corresponding signs and symptoms include fever cough shortness of breath myalgia fatigue ARDS arrhythmia and shock Laboratory results demonstrated altered liver function tests azotemia elevated troponin T elevated d dimer and elevated IL 6 levels 49 High levels of IL 1B IFN cid 31 IP 10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 MCP 1 have been detected in patients with COVID 19 These inflammatory cytokines activate the T helper type 1 Th1 cell response Th1 activation is a key event in the activation of specific immunity However unlike SARS COVID 19 patients also have elevated levels of Th2 cell secreted cytokines such as IL 4 and IL 10 which inhibit the inflammatory response Very high level of IL 6 Increased VEGF and coagulation factors which predispose microthrombi and thrombi formation Increased vascular permeability leading to interstitial edema pulmonary edema and multiorgan failure Figure 5 2 Flowchart describing the pathophysiology of a cytokine storm within COVID 19 5 3 1 Symptoms It is critical to understand how patients will present clinically for safe triage and risk assessment especially considering signs and symptoms of COVID 19 are nonspe cific following an incubation period of 2 14 days 7 Moreover presentations can range from patient s being asymptomatic to death A comprehensive joint report produced by WHO and China on COVID 19 n 55 924 demonstrated COVID 19 patients commonly present with pyrexia 87 9 dry cough 67 7 sputum production 33 4 and dyspnea 18 6 Other com mon symptoms are myalgia arthralgia chills headache sore throat nasal conges tion anosmia and ageusia 7 9 Early reports from China also stated that a few patients experienced rhinorrhea and haemoptysis 10 11 Anosmia and ageusia are more commonly found within COVID 19 patients who are younger and not hospital inpatients The majority of patients with the loss of taste or smell noticed an improvement within 2 weeks 12 Similar findings were present among pregnant patients who developed COVID 19 pneumonia 13 14 Interestingly studies have shown that children may be less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms compared to adults however they are just as likely to be infected Therefore the risk of transmission from children is yet to be understood 15 16 50 Chapter 5 Pulmonary Manifestations of COVID 19 Pathophysiology 5 3 2 Happy Hypoxics Among the many surprises of the novel coronavirus some patients seem to defy the basic physiology of hypoxia as they can be well observed generally and to describe themselves as comfortable with no signs of distress For such patients SpO2 and SaO2 have been reported as low as 62 and 69 respectively Clinicians call them happy hypoxics 17 18 5 3 3 Mechanism Swelling and inflammation in the lungs is likely to make oxygen perfusion difficult Figure 5 3 There is evidence that COVID 19 can cause blood clotting with the development of microthrombi thus affecting the entire body With a focus on the lungs microthrombi can occlude the very distal vessels participating in gas exchange Interestingly reports have shown anticoagulation drastically improving bluish discoloration of toes and shortness of breath 18 Therefore the severity of COVID 19 can be indicated by d dimer levels as it reflects coagulation cascade activation organ failure and cytokine storm A high level of d dimer during admis sion is associated with high mortality and morbidity As such anticoagulation will definitely be a cornerstone in the management of COVID 19 patients Figure 5 3 Lung CT scan of a COVID 19 positive patient demonstrating a lack of distal perfusion 19 51 5 4 Respiratory Failure SARS CoV causes acute pneumonia and is associated with a high mortality as rela tively clinically stable patients can suddenly deteriorate to severe respiratory failure SRF The most characteristic symptom of patients with COVID 19 is respiratory distress and most of the patients admitted to ICU cannot breathe spontaneously 20 This is supported by a study which found more than half of the patients admitted with dyspnea needed intensive care of which 46 65 of the patients worsened in a short period of time and died due to respiratory failure 20 The sudden clinical deterioration 7 8 days after the onset of symptoms suggests that SRF in COVID 19 is driven by a unique pattern of immune dysfunction 21 All patients with SRF displayed either cytokine storm or depletion of CD4 lympho cytes CD19 lymphocytes and natural killer NK cells The production of TNF and IL 6 by circulating monocytes was observed to be sustained unlike in bacterial sepsis or influenza This was partially restored by the IL 6 blocker tocilizumab Another study noticed that COVID 19 patients with acute respiratory failure present with severe hypercoagulability 22 Therefore the treatment of respiratory failure should include anticoagulation along with an appropriate management of the cytokine storm and ARDS 5 5 COVID 19 and Pulmonary Embolisms Acute infections have been known to cause a transient increased chance for a con current pulmonary embolism PE in the absence of other risk factors for vascular thromboembolisms VTEs 23 This has been highlighted further in a case report of a COVID 19 patient 24 Nonetheless many patients will have a lengthy hospitalized disease course with COVID 19 introducing immobilization as a risk factor for PEs too D dimer levels are typically used as a crude indicator for the chance of a patient having a thrombus formation However elevated d dimer levels may be misinter preted due to its acute phase reactant properties in light of the COVID 19 infection without appreciating a coexisting PE Considering a PE has a high risk of mortality if it is not managed it is pivotal for a patient s outcome to identify PEs as soon as possible However an autopsy study of a few COVID 19 positive patients revealed that in patients which were not sus pected to have VTE the direct cause of death was from a PE and others experienced deep vein thrombosis 25 Although the study had a small sample size it emphasizes the need to identify and manage the risk of developing VTE and thereby improving mortality More specifically with regard to management the relationship between PEs and COVID 19 has not been extensively studied the risk and benefit of prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation are to be determined Currently the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis ISTH encourages investigating patients who require admission into hospital with d dimer level prothrombin time platelet 52 Chapter 5 Pulmonary Manifestations of COVID 19 COVID 19 and COPD Table 5 1 Management of VTE Using LMWH for a Patient Weighing 70 kg and Has a CrCl 30 mL min29 Standard risk patient High risk patient Weight adjusted prophylactic dose LMWH eg dalteparin 5000 units OD enoxaparin 40 mg OD Intermediate dose LMWH eg dalteparin 5000 units BD enoxaparin 40 mg BD Proven or suspected acute VTE Therapeutic dose LMWH BD dosing may be preferred with critical care patients count and fibrinogen level as markers of prognosis in COVID 19 26 particularly considering that increased d dimer levels are associated with an increased mortality of COVID 19 patients 27 ISTH supported by experts and physicians across China and Europe 28 also advises the use of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin LMWH in all patients requiring admission for COVID 19 in the absence of con traindications and with monitoring for patients who have severe renal impairment 26 The use of LMWH would reduce the risk of developing a PE as well as decrease inflammation caused by COVID 19 and other comorbidities 26 The British Thoracic Society BTS has suggested possible dosages using an example of a 70 kg patient with creatinine clearance CrCl 30 Ml min as outlined in Table 5 1 Patients at high risk of developing VTE following discharge can be considered for extended thromboprophylaxis 29 Nevertheless BTS encourages liais ing with hematologists to formulate local protocols Cases published thus far have generally shown patients being managed for coro navirus and receiving prophylactic anticoagulation show an improvement before clinically deteriorating due to hypoxemia and increasing d dimer levels as well as require further anticoagulation to manage the PEs 30 31 This further justifies d dimer testing throughout an admission coupled with using computed tomography pulmo nary angiogram for patients with high d dimer levels on admission or sudden clini cal decline to quickly diagnose a PE 5 6 COVID 19 and COPD Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD is known to increase the mortality rates among community acquired pneumonias whereby patients are admitted to ICUs more frequently 32 As COVID 19 can be rapidly transmitted within a popula tion it is important to prepare for COVID 19 presentations with a background of COPD Especially since COPD patients may be more susceptible to COVID 19 a study has shown that patients with a history of COPD express increased levels of ACE2 receptors the reported entry gate of the virus 33 34 Meta analysis showed over fivefold increased risk for COPD patients to develop severe COVID 19 infections 35 The association between COPD and COVID 19 is important to understand to risk stratify patients and optimize the allocation of resources 53 Guidelines set by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence NICE in the UK advise patients with an existing COPD management plan which involves inhaled corticosteroids ICS to continue adherence and for professionals to delay any plans to withdraw it 36 With regard to self management NICE advises patients to follow their tailored rescue pack if they believe they are experiencing an exacerba tion as opposed to patients who believe they are experiencing COVID 19 symp toms who should not start oral corticosteroids and or antibiotics 36 This poses a problem since management is dependent upon patients to identify the differences between typical exacerbation symptoms and those caused by COVID 19 especially for patients who have been diagnosed with COPD recently Contradictory meta analysis studies have been published regarding the effect of smoking and COPD upon COVID 19 outcomes Lippi et al 37 did not find an asso ciation between active smoking and COVID 19 in a sample study of 1399 patients However Zhao et al 38 demonstrated a twofold increase in developing severe COVID 19 for active smokers which is also supported by Alqahtani et al 39 Despite conflicting evidence smoking cessation continues to be strongly encouraged for the management of COPD and COVID 19 by NICE 36 5 7 COVID 19 and Asthma Asthma can be triggered generally by viral illness poor adherence to medication and allergens Therefore it is important to identify if COVID 19 specifically has exacerbated symptoms and if management needs to be tapered differently to usual protocol A study found that the prevalence of asthma among COVID 19 patients was higher than the national average 40 However once the age gender and comorbidi ties were accounted for in the data asthma was not found to increase the risk of COVID 19 patients being hospitalized 40 Similarly ICS and or systemic corticoste roids were not found to increase the risk of hospitalization 40 Systemic steroid treatment may increase the viral load thus increasing the bur den of symptoms resulting in clinical decline However there is some early evi dence from sputum suggesting that ICS can reduce ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression 41 WHO has further conflicting evidence to counter ICS potentially being helpful at early stages 42 Therefore the use of ICS needs to be studied com prehensively to understand its effect upon the susceptibility and severity of COVID 19 Furthermore the use of nebulizers is generally effective in managing asthmatic patients however it is an aerosol generating treatment which is best avoided within health care environments Instead for such circumstances it is recommended to use inhalers containing dry powder or metered dose inhalers accompanied by a valve holding chamber 43 Biologic treatment is an interesting topic for the management of asthma Sound evidence supports moderate to severe patients with clinical indications to have 54 Chapter 5 Pulmonary Manifestations of COVID 19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome therapies targeting IL 5 IL 4 IL 13 and IGE 44 The lack of evidence to suggest biologic treatment is possibly harmful in the context of COVID 19 which implies it can be used with caution if the drug is effective and well tolerated 45 The main deterrent for a poor outcome with COVID 19 appears to be well man aged asthma as well as adherence to general advice such as hand hygiene shielding in certain groups of asthmatics social distancing effective inhaler technique and avoiding known triggers 5 8 COVID 19 and Lung Cancer Oncology societies and national authorities have been quick to issue guidelines on cancer care during the pandemic offering guidance and training to manage patients with cancer while this pandemic goes on especially considering individuals who are immunocompromised and over 60 years are at high risk of becoming infected with COVID 19 46 As a result the UK together with several other countries has generally suspended elective procedures NHS England warned that certain groups are particularly vulnerable to serious illness if they become infected with SARS CoV 2 These groups include individuals who are undergoing active chemotherapy or radical radiotherapy for lung cancer and patients with cancers of the blood or bone marrow 47 This is supported by a study done in China observing that non small cell cancer patients had higher inci dence of COVID 19 especially when the age is more than 60 years Patients with lung cancer have more severe COVID 19 than those without lung cancer 48 This has been further highlighted in Italy whereby 20 of COVID 19 deaths had a concur rent active cancer 5 9 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ARDS is the most common complication of severe COVID 19 It is a clinical syn drome characterized by severe respiratory distress hypoxemia and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema 5 9 1 Diagnostic Criteria All four of the following criteria must be present 1 Acute onset of illness 2 Chest X ray showing bilateral infiltrates 3 Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 18 mm Hg or a lack of congestive car diac failure 4 Refractory hypoxemia with pao2 Fio2 200 49 55 L phenotype H phenotype Figure 5 4 Chest CT scans demonstrating the difference between L type and H type ARDS 51 5 9 2 Clinical Features Symptoms Fever shortness of breath inability to complete sentences persistent nonproductive cough Signs Tachypnea tachycardia low mean BP hypoxia resistant to oxygen rhon chi and egophony throughout lung fields 5 9 3 Types of ARDS L phenotype of ARDS typically has low elastance ventilation perfusion mismatch low lung weight and low recruitability Figure 5 4 50 H phenotype of ARDS typically has high elastance high right to left shunt high lung weight and high recruitability 50 Radiologically chest X rays show bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and CT scans show a bilateral ground glass appearance with consolidation compatible with viral pneumonia Although severe COVID 19 follows all the criteria of ARDS mor tality was increasing when high positive end expiratory pressure PEEP was given to all patients with SARS CoV 2 In an independent study atypical presentation of ARDS in COVID 19 patients was observed thus stressing the importance to modify the management for ARDS to decrease mortality 52 A patient may also undergo a transition from L to H phenotype as the disease advances to more severe form This transition may be determined by inspiratory pleural pressure and esophageal pressure swings Considering esophageal pressure swings between 5 and 10 cmH20 is generally well tolerated a swing above 15 cmH20 is indicative of a risk for lung injury and warranting intubation as soon as possible 53 56 Chapter 5 Pulmonary Manifestations of COVID 19 Treatment 5 10 Outcome with Ventilated Patients Patients who are severely compromised will require ventilatory support Although oxy gen delivery may be increased with a non rebreathe mask or by pronating the patient additional albeit limited measures with non invasive or invasive ventilation will need to be utilized 54 Multiple facets of challenges regarding ventilators are becoming more evident with the demand carried by this pandemic For example the use of ventilators requires training maintenance spare parts and of course the equipment itself Hypoxemia is relatively well tolerated in patients without developing exhaustion or acute respiratory distress 18 therefore the optimal time to ventilate patients is dif ficult to determine Nonetheless happy hypoxic patients only represent a propor tion of COVID 19 cases High flow nasal cannula HFNC as a means to support COVID 19 patients has been uncertain and appears to be generally avoided HFNC has the ability to dis perse aerosol but with the addition of wearing a surgical mask over the nasal can nula the distance of dispersion is markedly reduced 55 Since surgical masks cannot be used over oxygen masks the microbiological contamination of the surroundings is not increased for patients using a surgical mask over HFNC compared to those supported by oxygen masks 55 This may be a possible method to manage hypoxemic COVID 19 patients avoiding intubation The use of noninvasive ventilation NIV is debatable since it is aerosol generating thus increasing the risk of further spreading COVID 19 among health care profes sionals This has been countered by first ensuring that there is a good interface fitting and the use of PPE by staff will minimize the risk of transmission 56 second aerosol generation and thus risk to staff was found to be higher with intubation 57 Therefore using NIV allows for invasive measures to be reserved for more poorly patients Invasive ventilation demonstrated significantly poor outcomes In the UK 67 of patients with COVID 19 receiving mechanical ventilation died as opposed to 22 with viral pneumonias in 3 years prior 58 Early studies from Wuhan highlighted that mortality rates increased from 52 62 for ICU patients to 86 97 when patients received mechanical invasive ventilation 59 This is partly explained by 40 of ventilated patients having ARDS which is associated with high mortality rates in itself 60 Nonetheless patients with ARDS and paO2 FiO2 150 had a better survival rate with early intubation as opposed to using NIV The majority of COVID 19 cases however are not associated with ARDS as such their lungs have near normal function which is not likely to be improved with high PEEP 61 Therefore other options should be considered 5 11 Treatment High virus titer and the subsequent strong inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses are related to the high morbidity and mortality Generally prophylactic dose of LMWH is recommended for hospitalized patients with COVID 19 to pre vent VTE 62 Potential treatment with other medication has been discussed below 57 5 11 1 Interferon IFN IFN primarily activates epithelial cells and reduces the mononuclear macro phage mediated pro inflammatory activity of INF 63 Early administration of interferons has certain benefits in reducing viral load and improves the clinical symptoms of patients to a certain extent However it fails to reduce mortality rate 5 11 2 Steroids The timing of administration and the dosage of glucocorticoids are very important to the outcome of the severely ill patients Administration of glucocorticoids too early inhibits the initiation of the body s immune defense mechanism thereby increasing the viral load and ultimately leading to aggravation of the disease which has been reported in non ICU patients 63 Timely administration of glucocorticoids in the early stage of inflammatory cytokine storm effectively prevents the occur rence of ARDS and protects the functions of the patients organs More specifically regarding the dosage short term steroids 3 5 days are appropriate and the recom mended dose is no more than the equivalent of methylprednisolone 1 2 mg kg day Large doses of glucocorticoid may delay the clearance of coronavirus due to immunosuppression 5 11 3 Tocilizumab Tocilizumab is an IL 6 antagonist that suppresses the function of the immune sys tem 63 Tocilizumab itself has a therapeutic effect on the infection induced cytokine storm Tocilizumab is effective in treating severely ill patients with extensive bilat eral lung lesions who have elevated IL 6 levels The first dose was 4 8 mg kg The recommended dosage was 400 mg with 0 9 saline diluted to 100 ml The infusion time was more than 1 h For patients with poor efficacy of the first dose a repeat dose can be applied after 12 h with a maximum of two cumulative doses Tocilizumab reduces patient morbidity and the need for mechanical ventilation but may fail in very advanced disease 6 5 11 4 Chloroquine Chloroquine inhibits the production and release of TNF and IL 6 which indicates that chloroquine may suppress the cytokine storm in patients infected with COVID 19 Chloroquine has an immune modulating activity and antiviral activ ity Chloroquine is known to block virus infection by increasing endosomal pH required for virus cell fusion as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cel lular receptors of SARS CoV 63 Chloroquine is a cheap and safe drug that has been used for more than 70 years and therefore it is potentially clinically 58 Chapter 5 Pulmonary Manifestations of COVID 19 References applicable against the COVID 19 There are various dosing regimens available in the literature 5 11 5 Remdesivir Remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue prodrug that inhibits viral RNA polymerase activity against SARS CoV 2 It also inhibits virus infection efficiently in a human cell line and recently recognized as a promising antiviral drug 64 Compassionate use of remdesivir in case of severe COVID 19 patients demonstrated a clinical improve ment in 68 of patients Effectiveness of a shorter duration of therapy that is 5 days as opposed to 10 days is to be investigated since it would allow the treatment of more patients during the pandemic References 1 Rothan HA Byrareddy SN The epidemiology and pathogenesis of coronavirus dis ease

Bharathan CHAPTER 06 List of Abbreviations ACE2 ECG HfpEF HFrEF RAAS SARS CoV 2 Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 Electrocardiogram Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction Renin angiotensin aldosterone system Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 6 1 Introduction There is an increased risk of cardiovascular involvement during respiratory viral infections This has been studied in the context of influenza Notably in most influ enza epidemics more patients died of cardiovascular causes compared to pneumo nia 1 In the context of COVID 19 it has become apparent that cardiovascular complication is a major cause of death particularly in individuals over 65 years of age who are likely to have various comorbidities such as diabetes hypertension and obesity These patients comprise the majority with cardiac involvement during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV 2 infection 2 This chapter will discuss the various cardiovascular manifestations of COVID 19 including cardiac inflammation heart failure stress cardiomyopathy and hyperco agulability Additionally the role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE2 will be addressed as well as possible long term cardiovascular sequelae that may result from SARS CoV 2 infection 6 2 Epidemiology In a study of 52 critically ill patients with COVID 19 it was found that 40 of patients had comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease chronic cardiac disease and cerebrovascular disease 3 Specifically more non survivors of COVID 19 in this 63 study had preexisting cardiovascular disease 53 vs 20 in survivors and preex isting cerebrovascular disease 22 vs 0 in survivors Additionally among the 52 critically ill patients cardiac injury indicated by increased levels of troponin I was reported in 23 of cases 3 Non survivors also showed higher rates of heart failure and acute cardiac injury when compared to survivors of COVID 19 3 After taking all of these statistics into consideration it is apparent that the cardiovascular system is significantly affected during SARS CoV 2 infection and it is clear that having preexisting cardiovascular conditions places individuals at a significant risk to poor outcomes in the face of COVID 19 Another study found similar results in which cardiovascular disease was more prevalent in patients who died due to COVID 19 than patients who survived 4 Additionally patients who died had higher levels of troponin myoglobin C reactive protein serum ferritin and interleukin 6 Such findings are suggestive of a high inflammatory burden in COVID 19 patients and a possible rise in myocarditis related cardiac events 4 While the mechanism of cardiac injury is not well established there are a few factors that could be contributing to such injury First there is likely an increase in cardiac demand due to the respiratory failure and hypoxemia that commonly occur during COVID 19 5 Second it is possible that a direct cardiac injury by SARS CoV 2 occurs Third there could be an indirect cardiac injury from the systemic inflammatory response elicited during SARS CoV 2 infection 5 And lastly the stress of COVID 19 may destabilize any preexisting cardiovascular pathologies 5 All four possible modalities of cardiac injury can result in arrhythmias heart failure or myocardial infarction Figure 6 1 Immunopathology Hyperinflammation SARS CoV 2 Direct Myocardial Injury Respiratory failure Hypoxemia Figure 6 1 COVID 19 cardiac effects 64 Biomarkers of injury Arrhythmia Acute Coronary Syndrome HFpEF HFrEF Chapter 6 Cardiovascular Manifestations of COVID 19 Cardiac Inflammation due to SARS CoV 2 6 3 The Role of ACE2 in the Cardiovascular System during COVID 19 It is well known that SARS CoV 2 infects cells via the ACE2 receptor Thus with the abundant ACE2 expression in heart it seems to be at an increased risk of infec tion 6 Notably SARS CoV 2 downregulates ACE2 expression which contributes to myocardial dysfunction This effect has been observed in ACE2 knockout mice exhibiting severe left ventricular dysfunction 7 Normally ACE2 degrades angioten sin II to generate angiotensin 1 7 which has vasodilatory and antiproliferative effects Such effects along with anti angiotensin II action prevent pathologic remodeling of the heart during heart failure and myocardial infarction 8 There is a significant controversy surrounding the use of renin angiotensin aldo sterone system RAAS antagonists strong influencers on the cardiovascular system during COVID 19 These medications have been found to increase ACE2 expression in many animal studies While such an increase in humans is helpful in cardiovascu lar disease it can theoretically increase susceptibility to SARS CoV 2 However the directionality of this effect is debated 9 10 In a study of 8900 patients with COVID 19 there was no association with the use of RAAS antagonists and increased in hospital mortality 11 Thus it is currently not recommended that ACE inhibitor and ARB ther apy two different modalities of RAAS antagonism be stopped 11 6 4 Cardiac Inflammation due to SARS CoV 2 Viral infections are known to commonly cause myocarditis and pericarditis In some cases this can be due to viruses exhibiting molecular mimicry a phenomenon where viral antigens share features with myocyte and or pericardial cell antigens 12 It is possible that SARS CoV 2 exhibits molecular mimicry In fact autopsies of patients who had confirmed COVID 19 show inflammatory infiltrates composed of macrophages and CD4 T cells These mononuclear infiltrates were associated with regions of cardiomyocyte necrosis 13 While such indications of myocardial inflam mation are present there has been no data to suggest the presence of SARS CoV 2 within myocardial tissue itself Such a finding would support the idea of SARS CoV 2 exhibiting molecular mimicry The clinical presentation of myopericarditis in COVID 19 can be similar to that of myocardial infarction Chest discomfort and fatigue have been primarily observed 14 In terms of diagnostic testing ST elevation on electrocardiogram ECG is a key find ing as well as increased levels of troponin T indicative of myocardial damage 14 Both of these findings are also observed in myocardial infarction In a case study from Italy a 53 year old patient with myopericarditis had no signs or symptoms of severe lung disease 14 The patient had only complained of a dry cough and fatigue in the week preceding her symptoms related to myopericarditis So it is apparent that inflamma tion of the heart can occur even in seemingly less severe cases of COVID 19 65 6 5 Heart Failure due to SARS CoV 2 Heart failure is another significant cardiac manifestation of COVID 19 5 Specifically heart failure can occur in the setting of SARS CoV 2 induced myocarditis However it is unclear whether SARS CoV 2 induced myocarditis more commonly results in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction HFpEF or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction HFrEF Though since most patients with uncomplicated lym phocytic myocarditis present with normal heart function this may indicate that HFpEF is more common 15 It is notable that since COVID 19 cases are highly con tagious an echocardiograph is risky to obtain so the status of left ventricular func tion may not be fully established in these patients Heart failure can also occur in the setting of arrhythmia which has been reported frequently in COVID 19 cases 16 Without an adequately functioning cardiac con duction system the heart is unable to pump blood effectively thus resulting in heart failure It is noteworthy that while arrhythmia can cause heart failure it can also be a result of heart failure Such a distinction is important when considering treatment options for the patient 6 6 Stress Cardiomyopathy due to SARS CoV 2 Stress or takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a condition that primarily affects women and can occur after a significant physical or emotional stressor 17 18 Viral infection has been found to trigger stress cardiomyopathy in some cases 19 In COVID 19 high inflammatory burden is a plausible trigger for this cardiac condition and there have been a few case reports of women exhibiting this illness 20 21 Although this condition is rarer than those already discussed it is worth noting some of its key findings Patients with stress cardiomyopathy have cardiac wall motion abnormalities that are apparent during echocardiography Additionally a low left ventricular ejection fraction is observed in this condition one much lower than that of acute coronary syndrome 17 It is important to differentiate stress cardiomyopathy from myocardial infarction especially since the ECG findings for both conditions can be very simi lar 20 Treatment for stress cardiomyopathy is conservative and many patients including one of the COVID 19 patients with this condition recover left ventricle function without invasive coronary procedures 20 A close monitoring is essential nonetheless since a declining left ventricle function can result in heart failure 20 6 7 Vascular Manifestations of COVID 19 There are a few possible mechanisms through which the vascular system is damaged in the setting of COVID 19 These mechanisms are similar to those likely affecting the cardiac system One possibility is that the damage caused by the virus in the lungs can result in hypoxia of the blood vessels and resulting vascular injury 22 Another pos sibility is that many ACE2 receptors in the vascular systems are prone to an increased risk of SARS CoV 2 infection 6 Lastly since COVID 19 affects many different organ 66 Chapter 6 Cardiovascular Manifestations of COVID 19 Possible Long Term Cardiovascular Implications Following COVID 19 systems and promotes an inflammatory state the vasculature can get damaged as a direct consequence of this state 22 Damage to the vasculature caused by any of these three mechanisms can lead to abnormal activation of the coagulation cascade Many COVID 19 patients have an increased D dimer level indicative of increased clot for mation 16 These patients have an increased likelihood of death during infection 22 Additionally it is notable that individuals with preexisting conditions that signifi cantly affect the blood vessels such as hypertension and diabetes tend to be at a greater risk of SARS CoV 2 infection and have poor outcomes during infection 22 A hypercoagulable state indicated by an increased levels of D dimer and fibrino gen is common during COVID 19 23 In such a state patients are at an increased risk of pulmonary embolism deep vein thrombosis stroke and disseminated intravascu lar coagulation All of these conditions can be extremely debilitating and potentially fatal In fact many COVID 19 patients in their 30s or 40s have presented with a stroke due to this hypercoagulable state 24 This is particularly alarming since the median age for severe stroke is 74 24 Therefore it is important for clinicians to moni tor all patients regardless of age for the conditions caused by hypercoagulability 6 8 Possible Long Term Cardiovascular Implications Following COVID 19 While the acute cardiovascular manifestations of COVID 19 are clear in their clinical presentation as discussed above it is important to keep in mind cardiovascular com plications that are possible even after recovery from acute illness Figure 6 2 depicts the concept that once the acute phase of the illness has resolved the long term com plications may arise in the convalescent and chronic phases of disease long after viral Acute Convalescent Chronic Host response I Y T R E V E S E S A E S D I Viral response 21 days months Years TIME COURSE after symptom onset ARDS Acute myocarditis Delayed myocarditis Cardiac arrest Hyperlipidemia Pulmonary fibrosis Figure 6 2 Long term sequelae of COVID 19 67 clearance has been achieved In some case reports from Italy fulminant myocarditis has been described to persist even after the resolution of acute respiratory symptoms While COVID 19 is a nascent pandemic long term sequelae are unknown but we can learn from the SARS CoV experience In a study of 25 individuals who had recovered from SARS CoV infection 12 years ago 68 had hyperlipidemia and 44 had cardiovascular abnormalities in the 2017 study 25 Additionally it was found that the lipid metabolisms of these individuals were significantly altered when compared to normal controls resulting in increased levels of serum lipids and free fatty acids 25 Such a hyperlipidemic state places these recovered SARS CoV patients at an increased risk for conditions such as atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction Since SARS CoV 2 is similar to SARS CoV it is possible that it will cause similar long term car diovascular effects It will be important in the future for clinicians to keep such effects in mind as more people get infected with COVID 19 during the pandemic 6 9 Conclusion It is clear that the cardiovascular system is not spared during SARS CoV 2 infec tion In particular individuals over 65 years of age with preexisting comorbidities such as diabetes hypertension and obesity are at an increased risk of severe cardio vascular complication 2 Common cardiovascular complications include myocardial infarction heart failure cardiac inflammation arrhythmia and hypercoagulability A less common cardiovascular complication is stress cardiomyopathy In addition to the acute cardiovascular conditions that occur during COVID 19 it is important to also consider the long term complications that may arise After the SARS CoV experience that occurred 12 years ago many patients who survived infection had altered lipid metabolism resulting in hyperlipidemia a state known to increase the risk of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction 25 Since SARS CoV 2 shares char acteristics with SARS CoV the long term sequelae that affected SARS CoV patients may also affect SARS CoV 2 patients many years from now Key Learning Points 1 Around one third of COVID 19 patients have been found to develop cardio vascular complications 2 The pathophysiology as to how the cardiovascular system is involved dur ing SARS CoV 2 infection is complex and multifactorial 3 Older patients with comorbidities are likely to suffer from acute atheroscle rotic complications 4 Younger and healthy patients rarely may develop acute fulminant myocar ditis leading to acute cardiac decompensation and malignant arrhythmia resulting in sudden death 5 The COVID 19 pandemic has changed the way cardiology is routinely practiced 68 Chapter 6 Cardiovascular Manifestations of COVID 19 References Summary of Cardiovascular Findings in COVID 19 Cardiovascular Complications Pathophysiology Myopericarditis Heart failure Arrhythmia Myocardial infarction Stress cardiomyopathy Possible molecular mimicry exhibited by SARS CoV 2 results in inflammation of the heart Preserved ejection fraction heart failure occurs due to myocarditis Heart failure can also occur due to arrhythmia secondary to cardiac injury Stress cardiomyopathy can result in heart failure as well Arrhythmia can be due to heart failure myocarditis or the cardiac injury that occurs in SARS CoV 2 infection Myocardial infarction can occur due to the cardiac injury caused by SARS CoV 2 infection Physiologic stress high inflammatory burden hypoxia etc due to SARS CoV 2 infection results in stress cardiomyopathy Pulmonary embolism stroke deep vein thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation Vascular injury caused by SARS CoV 2 results in a hypercoagulable state that has been found in many COVID 19 patients indicated by elevated fibrinogen and D dimer References 1 Madjid M and Casscells S Of birds and men cardiologists role in influenza pandemics Lancet 2004 364 9442 1309 2 Cdc gov COVID 19 Provisional Counts

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 7 1 Introduction There have been several reported cases that have demonstrated that infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV 2 can have neurologi cal manifestations ranging from mild to severe symptoms and may also involve the central nervous system CNS peripheral nervous system PNS and or skeletal muscle Among the most common neurological manifestations of SARS CoV 2 is the loss of sense of taste and or smell typically by the third day 1 It is important to know that patients may present with neurological symptoms as the first or only sign of the SARS CoV 2 infection This chapter discusses the common and rare neuro logical manifestations of SARS CoV 2 that have been reported so far 71 7 2 How SARS CoV 2 Can Infect the Nervous System Although the exact manner with which SARS CoV 2 acts on the nervous system has yet to be found there are a few probable explanations The ACE2 receptor has been identified as the primary receptor involved with the SARS CoV 2 virus Because this receptor is expressed in skeletal muscles and throughout the nervous system they can be considered as capable of being infected by the SARS CoV 2 virus via either direct or indirect methods 2 Autopsies of COVID 19 positive patients demonstrated brain tissue that was hyperemicand edematous and had degenerated neurons 2 It is also probable for SARS CoV 2 to infect the CNS by dissemination of SARS CoV 2 through the olfactory bulb and cribriform plate or due to hematogenous spread of the virus from systemic to cerebral circulation 3 Previous coronavirus infections like SARS CoV have demonstrated neurological manifestations of the virus 4 Autopsies of patients infected with SARS CoV detected the presence of SARS CoV nucleic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid CSF and brain tissue 2 Previous studies showed that SARS CoV infected patients had developed rhabdomyolysis myopathy and seizures 5 There were also reports of Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS patients dur ing the MERS outbreak developing neurological symptoms of confusion and seizures 5 The first reported neurological study in Wuhan China 2 examined 214 consecu tive COVID 19 positive patients mean age of 52 7 years 3 who were treated at three different hospitals from January 16 to February 19 and their illness was cat egorized by severity based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines for com munity acquired pneumonia Table 7 1 According to these guidelines 41 1 88 of patients had severe infection and 58 9 126 of patients had nonsevere infec tion Neurological symptoms were categorized into four categories Table 7 1 Key Neurological Findings from the Study Neurologic Manifestations of Hospitalized Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Wuhan China2 Summary of Key Neurological Findings 19 214 COVID 19 patients had PNS manifestations 12 had impaired taste 11 had impaired smell 3 had impaired vision 53 214 COVID 19 hospitalized patients had CNS manifestations 35 had dizziness 28 had headache 16 had impaired consciousness 6 had acute cerebrovascular disease 1 had ataxia 1 had seizure 23 214 COVID 19 hospitalized patients had

smell taste and or vision Cerebrovascular disease seizure stroke ataxia Skeletal muscle symptoms Of the 214 patients 36 4 had neurologic manifestations ie CNS PNS skel etal muscle Patients with severe infection were more likely to be older and have hypertension and had fewer typical COVID 19 symptoms cough fever compared to those with nonsevere infection and patients with severe infection were more likely to develop neurologic manifestations compared to those with nonsevere infection 2 38 8 83 had one or more comorbidity hypertension diabetes cardiac or cerebrovascular disease malignancy or chronic kidney disease Such neurologi cal symptoms mostly manifested in the early period of the illness the median time to hospital admission 1 2 days 2 7 3 Cerebrovascular Disease There have been reports of strokes in patients who have tested positive for COVID 19 and particularly in younger patients patients younger than 50 years of age when patients who typically get strokes are 74 years 6 Based on the laboratory studies of COVID 19 positive patients done so far it is known that COVID 19 is frequently associated with increased D dimer levels Increased D dimer levels may be indicative of blood clots through detecting an irregularly high amount of fibrin degradation material 7 Blood clots have been seen as a very concerning symptom of COVID 19 and it is believed that the SARS CoV 2 is infecting blood vessels8 One study demonstrated how SARS CoV 2 had infected the endothelial cells lin ing the inside of blood cells 8 Blood clotting is especially problematic in patients in critical condition those who are immobilized and those with preexisting condi tions that already put strain on the involved systems such as diabetes and hypertension Some patients are presenting with stroke as the first symptom of COVID 19 and these strokes are also appearing in COVID 19 positive patients with no known heart conditions or no other underlying illnesses such as hypertension or diabetes 9 In the Wuhan study 14 strokes out of 214 COVID 19 positive patients 3 In a study of 10 COVID 19 positive patients with an age range of 25 75 years who had suffered from an ischemic stroke 80 had preexisting conditions such as diabetes or hypertension but none had preexisting cerebrovascular disease coronary disease or atrial fibrillation 10 Patients showed increased laboratory values of D dimer 80 of these patients also presented to the emergency room ER initially with neurological symptoms rather than respiratory symptoms two passed away from stroke two passed away from the coronavirus attacking their lungs and one was in critical condition due to acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS 10 Patients had either branch emboli small vessel or large vessel occlusion LVO 10 There were five patients who had LVO three of whom ended in mortality and one 73 of whom was the patient in critical condition due to ARDS 10 Patients with LVO were associated with either cardioembolism or hypercoagulable state 10 A retrospective cohort study published on May 13 2020 in stroke examined all patients admitted for stroke between March 15 2020 and April 19 2020 across New York University Langone Hospital locations in Brooklyn Long Island and Manhattan 11 They were divided into three groups patients who had ischemic stroke and were simultaneously COVID 19 positive the contemporary controls who were patients who had ischemic stroke and did not have COVID 19 and the historical controls which were patients who had ischemic stroke and who were discharged from the hospital system between Match 15 2019 and April 15 2019 11 The results showed that only 32 0 9 of the 3556 hospitalized COVID 19 positive patients had imaging confirmed ischemic strokes with 63 years of age being the median age of the 32 patients and 71 9 being men 11 More studies are needed to clarify if there is an association between SARS CoV 2 and ischemic stroke Table 7 2 Table 7 2 Cases of

came out negative 14 CT computed tomography and MRI mag netic resonance imaging scans confirmed the ANE diagnosis Acute necrotizing encephalopathy also known as acute necrotizing encephalopathy of childhood is a rare type of encephalopathy characterized by multiple bilateral brain lesions 15 It was first discovered in Eastern pediatric populations in 1995 but is rare in western countries and adult populations 16 Another report described a case of a 24 year old man who was infected with SARS CoV 2 and developed meningoencephalitis 17 He presented with a fatigue and fever on day 1 sought a doctor on day 2 and was prescribed laninamivir and antipyretic agents because of clinical symptoms on day 5 his symptoms worsened with the addition of sore throat and headaches and on day 9 he was found uncon scious and rushed to the hospital by ambulance 17 He had generalized seizures for a minute and at the hospital tested negative for SARS CoV 2 using the nasal swab test but tested positive for SARS CoV 2 in his CSF 17 Brain MRIs were taken 20 hours after admission demonstrating right lateral ventriculitis and encephalitis on the right mesial lobe of the hippocampus with a differential diagnosis of hippocam pal sclerosis 17 There has been one case so far of meningitis seen in a 5 year old girl She was complaining of a headache and had a fever for about a month and had tested positive for COVID 19 The child then developed meningitis and spent 2 weeks on a ventila tor before passing away She was taken off the ventilator after she was no longer improving and physicians believed she was brain dead 18 A study of HCV OC42 examines whether a respiratory virus can infect the CNS and cause brain inflammation 3 Because there have not been many cases of SARS CoV 2 being tied to meningitis and or encephalitis more studies need to be done in order to substantiate this relationship Table 7 3 7 5 Headaches Patients who are positive for COVID 19 have presented with headaches as a symp tom of the virus 3 In the meningitis case of the 5 year old girl she initially presented with headaches as the only symptom of COVID 19 for a month 18 However this appears to be an isolated occurrence Therefore headaches may be a result of the systemic disease rather than a direct invasion of the CNS by the virus and this is especially likely in patients who have no other neurological symptoms 3 75 Table 7 3 Cases of Encephalitis Tied to SARS CoV 2 Study Key Neurological Findings COVID 19 linked to rare form of encephalitis14 A first case of meningitis encephalitis

that previous coronavi ruses such as SARS CoV and MERS had PNS manifestations such as weakness and decreased deep tendon reflexes 3 According to the Wuhan study there were no significant differences in the labo ratory studies between patients with and without PNS manifestations and there were no significant differences between those patients with PNS systems and severe infection and those with PNS manifestations and without severe infection 2 There have been 12 reported cases of Guillain Barr syndrome in COVID 19 positive patients 3 Guillain Barr syndrome is a rare disorder where the body s immune system attacks its nerves 19 It can cause muscle weakness and occasionally paralysis 19 Of these 12 patients 5 were from Northern Italy and they all developed Guillain Barr syndrome after the onset of COVID 19 and systemic manifestations of COVID 19 20 At the onset of their neurological symptoms 4 out of these 5 patients tested positive on the SARS CoV 2 nasopharyngeal swab test and 1 tested negative 20 Four patients developed weakness in their lower extremities and facial diplegia and one patient developed paresthesia and ataxia 20 Over a 3 to 4 day period four of the patients also developed generalized flaccid tetraparesis or tet raplegia and three of whom received mechanical ventilation 20 These patients showed first symptoms of Guillain Barr syndrome 5 10 days after first onset of symptoms of COVID 20 Among the other 7 of the 12 patients 76 Chapter 7 Central Nervous System CNS Manifestations of COVID 19 Peripheral Nervous System Manifestations there were instances of patients presenting with neurological manifestations prior to COVID 19 diagnosis Several of these patients had also developed systemic mani festations such as fever and cough and ground glass lung opacities in either one or both lungs either before or after developing neurological manifestations There have also been cases of patients who were infected with MERS CoV and patients who have been infected with HCV OC43 and who have also developed Guillain Barr syndrome 17 These are only a few cases so more research needs to be done in order to substantiate that there is a relationship between SARS CoV 2 and Guillain Barr syndrome Table 7 4 Table 7 4 Cases of Guillain Barr Syndrome Tied to SARS CoV 2 Patient Age Sex 61 y o F 64 y o M Neurologic symptoms and COVID 19

Patient s condition improved with normal lymphocyte and thrombocyte levels were normal Day 30 of hospital admission Discharged with normal muscle strength in all extremities normal tendon reflexes no respiratory symptoms and tested negative on SARS CoV 2 oropharyngeal 79 7 7 Skeletal Muscle Injury According to the laboratory values from the Wuhan study patients who had skeletal muscle injury had significantly higher levels of creatine kinase compared to those who had no skeletal muscle injury regardless of the disease severity 2 The laboratory values of patients with skeletal muscle injury showed an evidence of an increased inflammatory response through increased neutrophil counts lower lymphocyte counts and greater C reactive protein levels and also showed an evidence of possi ble blood coagulation dysfunction through the increased D dimer levels 2 The labo ratory values of patients who had skeletal muscle injury also showed an evidence of damage to multiple organs liver increased lactate dehydrogenase aspartate amino transferase and alanine aminotransferase where the levels in patients with severe infection were significantly higher than the levels of those with nonsevere infection and kidney abnormalities increased levels of blood urea nitrogen where the blood urea nitrogen levels were significantly higher in patients with severe infection than in those with nonsevere infection and increased levels of creatine 2 7 8 Conclusion 1 Patients diagnosed with COVID 19 can develop neurological manifestations that can affect the CNS or PNS or cause skeletal muscle injury 2 Patients may present with neurological manifestation prior to COVID 19 diag nosis and or without displaying any of the symptoms typical to COVID 19 such as fever and cough 3 Possible CNS manifestations seen so far include headache dizziness loss of consciousness and cerebrovascular disease and there have only been a few cases of encephalitis and meningitis 4 Possible PNS manifestations seen so far include the loss of sense of taste smell and vision and rare manifestation seen in Guillain Barr syndrome 5 Patients infected with the SARS CoV 2 virus who had no comorbidities or risk factors for cerebrovascular disease have been shown to develop cerebrovascular disease as a neurological manifestation References 1 Smell diminishes by day 3 of COVID 19 study

SARS CoV 2 American College of Gastroenterology Fecal immunohistochemistry test Gastrointestinal Inflammatory bowel disease Personal protective equipment Proton pump inhibitor Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 8 1 Introduction COVID 19 has many gastrointestinal GI manifestations which can present even in the absence of respiratory symptoms and also has an impact on many GI dis eases Gastroenterology utilizes minimally invasive endoscopic procedures to diag nose monitor and treat pancreatic GI and hepatobiliary diseases including GI bleeding gastroesophageal reflux disease pancreatitis inflammatory bowel disease IBD celiac disease cirrhosis hepatitis and colorectal cancer Immunosuppressive agents including biologic medications and steroids are used to treat disorders such as IBD and autoimmune hepatitis Many nonurgent endoscopies were temporarily put on hold from March 2020 through April 2020 due to concerns for SARS CoV 2 transmission particularly with aerosol generating endoscopic procedures and fecal oral route of viral spread and to preserve personal protective equipment PPE in the setting of widespread shortage With adequate supplies of proper PPE and decrease in COVID 19 cases elective outpatient endoscopic procedures resumed in most facilities by late May 2020 This chapter addresses the GI manifes tations of COVID 19 and the virus s impact on various GI diseases and access to endoscopy 83 8 2 Presentation Patients infected with SARS CoV 2 frequently develop or present with GI symp toms such as anorexia diarrhea nausea vomiting and abdominal pain 1 3 A figure adapted from a meta analysis of over 4000 patients positive for COVID 19 showing the distribution of GI symptoms is illustrated in Figure 8 1 Although the prevalence of GI symptoms was low in early studies there was a large discrepancy between Chinese and non Chinese studies 3 One possible explanation of the difference between studies is whether anorexia is included as a GI symptom as it could be included in other organ systems and was not reported in many early Chinese stud ies When reported anorexia is often times the most frequently reported GI symp tom and may be present in up to 60 of cases 1 2 4 5 There is a small but measurable number of cases presenting as acute pancreatitis which affected Blacks and Hispanics at significantly higher rates highlighting the racial disparities seen with this disease 6 Although respiratory symptoms are the primary presenting symptom of COVID 19 many patients have co occurring GI symptoms and some patients develop GI symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms In one study of 206 patients with mild COVID 23 had only digestive symptoms and 33 had a mixture of diges tive and respiratory symptoms 7 Multiple studies have shown that patients with GI symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms take longer to present to the hospital rendering the risk of propagating community viral spread for longer GI

Endoscopy and Risk of Transmission periods of time 1 7 Additionally these patients may have a longer duration between symptom onset and viral clearance taking up to an additional 7 days to clear the virus compared to patients with respiratory symptoms 7 This suggests that GI symp toms should not be overlooked and should prompt a rapid consideration of addi tional workup and monitoring The virus has been isolated from feces of infected persons and can persist in the stool up to 10 days after resolution of symptoms after it clears the respiratory sys tem raising concern for possible fecal oral transmission 8 9 In fact some case stud ies have isolated intact virus in the stool but direct transmission has not yet been observed 10 Patients with COVID 19 often have abnormal liver enzymes which may or may not be present on initial presentation It has been hypothesized that the development of transaminitis could be related to biology of the virus which enters cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 membrane protein receptor and is highly expressed in the colon liver and cholangiocytes11 however there are various other possible etiologies which will be discussed later in this chapter 8 3 Endoscopy and Risk of Transmission Gastroenterologists routinely perform aerosol generating procedures including esophagogastroduodenoscopy colonoscopy sigmoidoscopy small bowel enteros copy endoscopic ultrasound endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and esophageal manometry 12 The risk of viral transmission during upper endoscopies is of particular concern as viral particles may become aerosolized during the insertion of the endoscopy into the pharynx triggering the gag reflex and from the endo scope s working channel as instruments are inserted and removed 12 During the surge of the COVID 19 pandemic elective procedures colon cancer screening GI motility testing variceal surveillance etc were delayed due to the concern for SARS CoV2 transmission When urgent emergent procedures were performed symptomatic GI bleeding dysphagia significantly impacting oral intake cholangi tis GI obstruction the following procedural precautions were recommended 12 Use a fitted N95 masks N99 or powered air purifying respirators PAPRs instead of surgical masks or no masks Double glove instead of single glove If the patient is positive for SARS CoV2 or presumptive use a negative pressure room or if unavailable in resource limited settings use portable industrial grade high efficiency particulate air HEPA filters in a regular endoscopy room Continue to utilize standard cleaning endoscopic disinfection and reprocess ing protocols which includes mechanical and detergent cleaning using US Food and Drug Administration FDA approved liquid chemical germicide solutions followed by high level disinfection reduces the number of micro organisms by 99 99 rinsing and sterile drying The biocidal agents used in 85 endoscopic disinfecting solutions have been shown to be effective in inacti vating SARS CoV 13 Guidance from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ASGE for resuming elective endoscopy as the number of COVID 19 cases decreased includes the following 14 Administer a COVID 19 screening questionnaire to patients within 72 hours prior to the endoscopic procedure to elicit whether the patient had any of the following symptoms within 14 days fever 100 4 or higher cough shortness of breath difficulty breathing chest pain sore throat loss of sense of smell taste new onset of fatigue nausea diarrhea or other significant symptoms Positive responses should prompt the removal of patients from clinical care areas repeat SARS CoV2 testing self quarantine and reporting to the proper authorities eg Department of Health All members of the endoscopy team should wear N95 respirators or devices with equivalent or higher filtration rates for all GI procedures Standard bedside precleaning followed by manual cleaning and high level disinfection in the reprocessing facility no changes are recommended to reprocessing procedures for endoscopes and accessories There is flexibility in guidance from the American College of Gastroenterology ACG in resuming elective procedures depending on the prevalence of COVID 19 availability of testing and availability of PPE with N95 or equivalent masks Figure 8 2 The chart below from the ACG suggests a reasonable algorithm for elective outpatient endoscopic procedure performed in free standing endoscopy centers 15 GI ASC Patient Low Prevalence Area Negative COVID 19 Test

in hospital setting with N95 or equivalent mask Figure 8 2 Adapted from ACG roadmap for resuming endoscopy 15 86 Chapter 8 Gastrointestinal Manifestations of COVID 19 Inflammatory Bowel Disease 8 4 Liver Diseases Many patients with COVID 19 either present with liver enzyme abnormalities or develop them over the course of their illness A meta analysis showed serum amino transferase levels AST or ALT above the upper limit of normal in roughly 15 of patients and elevated bilirubin in 17 16 One study of 1099 patients in China showed that there were more than double the number of patients with an AST 40 with severe illness compared to those with nonsevere illness 17 and a retrospective study of 1087 patients showed an association between COVID 19 infection and an eleva tion in baseline liver enzymes peak liver enzymes and severity of illness 18 Of note there are several confounding factors such as medications used to treat the infection that were also linked with elevated peak liver enzyme levels 18 The mechanism of action of liver injury is unclear but likely secondary to viral infection inflammatory reaction or toxin mediated from medications It is usually transient but there are case reports of COVID presenting as acute liver injury 19 20 Upon autopsy liver pathology revealed moderate microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity 21 To our knowledge there have not been reports of fulmi nant hepatic failure as a result of COVID 19 An international database has reported 1097 cases of COVID 19 in patients with chronic liver disease at the time of writing of this chapter The cohort includes 88 hospitalized patients but does report 18 29 probability of severe disease requir ing intensive care admission 22 Patients with cirrhosis had the worst outcomes with a 32 chance of death Additional prospective studies will be required to further evaluate the relative and overall risk compared to the general population 8 5 Inflammatory Bowel Disease Inflammatory bowel disease namely Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis is esti mated to have a prevalence of 6 8 million globally 23 An international database SECURE IBD has reported 2 156 cases of confirmed COVID 19 in IBD patients from 57 countries 65 deaths 3 as of August 31 2020 24 The website is available at covidibd org and is continually updated So far the use of any of the biologics or Janus kinase JAK inhibitor is not associated with higher death rates or worse outcomes Patients with IBD are of special consideration during the COVID 19 pandemic as these patients are often treated with chronic immunosuppressive or immune modify ing therapies that include corticosteroids biologics including antitumor necrosis factor anti integrin and anti interleukin therapies immunomodulators and 5 ami nosalicylic acids 25 Moreover patients with IBD may continue to need frequent encounters at health care facilities for medication administration infusion of certain biologic therapies endoscopy assessment of disease severity in patients with active IBD symptoms and emergency department visits or hospitalization for IBD flares In addition to the recommendations for the general population social distancing hand hygiene work from home avoid infected persons IBD patients are recommended 87 to continue their IBD medication regimens to avoid the risk of relapsing IBD defer all nonessential endoscopic procedures during surge of COVID 19 cases including colon cancer screening and continue to receive medications at infusion centers with appro priate safety protocols fever checks at the door chairs spaced at least 6 feet apart disin fect equipment and furniture after each use utilize PPE etc 25 27 For IBD patients with GI symptoms rule out enteric infections such as Clostridioides difficile and other GI pathogens and test for active inflammation with non endoscopic approaches such as biomarkers serum C reactive protein fecal cal protectin cross sectional imaging and capsule endoscopy During the COVID 19 pandemic particularly for patients who test positive for SARS CoV 2 endoscopic procedures should only perform for urgent and emergent indications that will urgently change management This may include scenarios where there is clinical suspicion for a new diagnosis of severe IBD endoscopy needed for histological con firmation or stricturing disease causing GI obstruction that need urgent endoscopic decompression stenting and evaluation of cancer to guide surgical intervention 25 26 The recommended management of IBD therapies in patients who test positive for SARS CoV 2 is as follows continue 5 ASA budesonide rectal therapies and enteral nutrition hold thiopurines methotrexate and tofacitinib delay 2 week administration of monoclonal biologic therapies and restart when COVID 19 symptoms resolve or if serological testing demonstrate convalescent stage of the disease 25 These guidelines will be updated as the SECURE IBD Registry 24 and other studies provide more data analysis 8 6 Celiac Disease A multinational collaboration was created to anonymously report cases of celiac disease and coronavirus 28 At the time of the writing of this chapter only 62 cases have been reported with 82 being treated in the outpatient setting and 18 inpa tient and 2 1 patient requiring the intensive care unit ICU These data follow the general trend seen with the coronavirus in the general population In one Italian study the majority of patients did not feel more vulnerable to the coronavirus given their celiac disease and half of those surveyed did not worry about the availability of gluten free food 29 Overall it appears that COVID 19 does not impact patients with celiac disease more than the general population 8 7 GI Cancers In general patients with comorbidities including cancer of all types have a higher risk for severe COVID 19 30 As such various oncological and GI professional soci eties have produced guidelines for which procedures therapies and screenings are appropriate Currently there is no evidence which necessitates withholding systemic chemo therapy or immunotherapy for cancer 31 However the Infectious Disease Society of America recommends that patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy should be 88 Chapter 8 Gastrointestinal Manifestations of COVID 19 GI Cancers tested for SARS CoV 2 RNA even if asymptomatic 32 According to the Society of Surgical Oncology in gastric and esophageal cancers staging laparoscopy may be skipped in favor of beginning neoadjuvant therapy directly in a COVID 19 positive patient in order to reduce transmission risk and use of PPE Patients on neoadjuvant therapy for gastric and esophageal cancers may also continue chemotherapy if they are responding to treatment and there is not enough PPE to proceed with surgical resection Physicians at Sloan Kettering have deemed resection of colon stomach pancreas and liver cancers as essential as patient outcomes will be worsened with delay 33 This approach was also validated by guidance from the American College of Surgeons ACS and the New York State Department of Health Full guidelines provided by Oncological and Gastrointestinal Societies are provided in the Cancer Screening Guidelines section On the other hand others advocate that chemotherapy may also be used to delay surgery for hepato pancreato biliary can cer as long as the patient is responding to and tolerating treatment 34 Cancer screening guidelines have also been changed due to COVID 19 The American College of Physicians recommends a colonoscopy every 10 years or a sigmoidoscopy every 5 years between 50 and 75 years of age 35 However due to the pandemic these important screenings are being delayed A study gathered from the EPIC electronic health records system involving 2 7 million patients across 39 health systems with 190 hospitals and spanning 23 states in the USA demonstrated screening appointments for breast colon and prostate cancer in March of 2020 decreased by 86 compared to mean volumes from January 1 2017 to January 19 2020 Figure 8 3 36 The graphs of the drop in colon cancer screening are

appointments for cancers between 2017 and March 2020 36 89 below The charity Cancer Research UK estimates a backlog of 2 1 million patients waiting for breast colon or cervical cancer screening Normally about 3800 can cers would be diagnosed over this time period 37 In Hong Kong screening endosco pies and colonoscopies reached a turning point and began to decrease in January 2020 The mean weekly numbers of gastric and colon cancer diagnoses decreased by 46 and 37 respectively Cancer Research UK s Dr Charles Swanton warns that delays to diagnosis and treatment could mean that some cancers will become inoperable 37 While the European Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Guidelines ESGE and other GI professional societies recommend noninvasive proce dures such as the fecal immunohistochemistry FIT test in the meantime there cannot be an indefinite delay there is a significant increase in cancer risk with a 6 month delay in colonoscopy after positive FIT test 35 Already the effects of decreased screening are becoming apparent As a result of the NHS suspending cancer screening 3800 people in the UK whose cancer would have been picked up by screening have gone undiagnosed and another 20 300 cancers may also have been missed due to an estimated 290 000 patients with symptoms of possible cancer who were not urgently referred for evaluation 30 Statistical models of data from Hong Kong show that 4 6 of gastric cancers and 6 4 of colon cancers would have a more advanced stage of cancer at detection 6 months after the decrease in screenings 37 The data from these studies from Hong Kong the UK and the United States demon strate the danger of prolonged deferment of screening many treatable can cers not just colorectal cancer will progress unnoticed until it may be too late for the patient Gradually resuming elective endoscopic procedures may begin to mitigate some of these effects for colon cancer 38 Tracking patients whose elective procedures have been delayed and getting them rescheduled is an important part of this process As such it is of utmost importance for hos pitals and endoscopy centers to safely resume screening endoscopies and

without inter ruption during the COVID 19 pandemic Though only a minority of gastroenterolo gists private or academic were offering telehealth services prior to COVID 19 the vast majority have rapidly adapted this technology for offering care and will likely continue this option as patients find it convenient and cost time effective Most elec tronic health platforms have incorporated a telehealth option and there are several inexpensive or free platforms such as Doxy me or Doximity This access to care is particularly important in optimally managing chronic conditions including IBD and liver disease The American Gastroenterological Association AGA and the American College of Gastroenterology ACG assisted GI practices with their tran sition to telehealth by partnering the following Rx

commonly used to treat esophageal and gastric diseases such as GERD esopha gitis Barrett s esophagus and peptic ulcer disease There is conflicting data regard ing an association or causation between PPI and COVID 19 infection rate as well as severity One large survey based study of more than 50 000 patients in the United States showed a dose responsive relationship between PPIs and COVID infection however a larger retrospective study in Korea did not find any significant difference in infection rate between PPI users and nonusers 39 40 The latter study did find that PPI use correlated with a more severe course of illness To date no randomized con trol trials have been published regarding PPI use and development of COVID 19 91 Studies on SARS CoV 1 suggested the virus was less infective at lower pH pro viding a potential mechanism for increased infectivity 41 Interestingly with regard to the current studies on SARS CoV 2 there was no similar association between SARS CoV 2 and histamine 2 blocker use which also lowers gastric pH indicating that there may be other pathophysiologic mechanisms to infection Famotidine was actually associated with a decreased risk of intubation or death and is currently being investigated as a potential treatment for the virus 42 43 An association between PPIs and COVID 19 is concerning particularly given the prevalence of PPI use in modern society however it needs to be further evaluated with prospective studies and randomized controlled trials to determine causation Until these studies are completed we recommend that practitioners discuss this data with patients using shared decision making to determine whether to continue with PPIs or consider a transition to alternate therapies such as H 2 blockers The American Journal of Gastroenterology has also published an information sheet not ing that the absolute risk of COVID 19 infection is low and that social distancing and masks will have a much greater impact on personal risk of acquiring COVID 19 than adjusting PPI dosing 44 As we await further trials for now it is prudent to consider the potential increased risk for COVID 19 when discussing the use of PPIs with patients 8 10 Tools for Health care Providers American College of Gastroenterology COVID and GI https gi org media covid 19 and gi AASLD COVID 19 resources https www aasld org sites default files

thromboembolism 9 1 Introduction Acute kidney injury AKI is a major health concern as it often results in fatal com plications following intensive care unit ICU admission COVID 19 is a peculiar disease with a highly variable disease course and it has been seen to have multiple renal manifestations These can range from symptoms like hematuria to the devel opment of acute kidney failure The rapidly progressive kidney damage warrants early admission and a close clinical monitoring Multiple mechanisms leading to the development of renal manifestations have been proposed including volume depletion effects systemic inflammation hemo dynamic disturbances direct viral invasion and rhabdomyolysis among others 95 While maintenance of adequate fluid balance is pivotal parameters such as oxygen saturation blood urea nitrogen BUN creatinine urine output and arterial or venous pressures should be closely monitored Early assessment of volume status through the combined use of physical examination and ultrasound imaging is essen tial to avoid renal complications Maintenance of euvolemia using appropriate hydration fluid reducing medications and other necessary measures is the single most important step Another more worrisome complication is the development of venous thrombo embolism VTE in some patients Heparin prophylaxis or other anticoagulation may be used in the hospital setting to prevent VTE in COVID 19 patients Use of angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ARBs in COVID 19 patients is controversial due to the possibility of worsening of the disease course Thus we advise that clinicians exercise extreme precaution while using any of these medications 9 2 Epidemiology There is mounting evidence that COVID 19 can manifest as AKI Though the pool of data collected on this subject is preliminary it is clear that there is a trend of renal injury beyond simply the baseline level expected in similar populations A recent study of 193 COVID 19 patients in Wuhan China reported that many patients showed signs of kidney dysfunction upon admission to the hospital More than half of these patients had proteinuria about half had hematuria and some had increased BUN and creatinine levels 1 The multinational Acute Kidney Injury Epidemiologic Prospective Investigation AKI EPI study estimated the baseline level of AKI inci dence in all ICU admissions to be 57 3 while 13 5 of all ICU admissions develop severe AKI requiring renal replacement therapy RRT 2 This latter number is known to be higher in cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS The American Society of Nephrology estimates from many preliminary studies that the incidence of AKI in COVID 19 admissions is likely similar to the baseline but the percentage of COVID 19 ICU cases with severe AKI requiring RRT is increasing at an upward rate of 30 3 Thus the current research suggests that COVID 19 patients often end up with much more severe kidney injury This is important as AKI can increase an already high mortality risk in these patients A univariate Cox regression analysis showed that proteinuria hematuria and increased BUN serum creatinine and uric acid levels were all significantly associated with death in COVID 19 patients This study also found that COVID 19 patients who developed AKI had an increased mortality risk compared to those without AKI by a factor of 5 3 1 Given the propensity of COVID 19 to damage the kidney it poses an even greater danger to patients who already carry a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease CKD A recent meta analysis preprint reported that patients with CKD have a six fold increased risk of developing severe COVID 19 infection over the general population 4 96 Chapter 9 Renal Manifestations of COVID 19 Pathophysiology of COVID 19 Renal Manifestations 9 3 Pathophysiology of COVID 19 Renal Manifestations There have been multiple suggested etiologies of AKI due to COVID 19 3 These etiologies likely work together to attack the kidney from several angles These can be broadly categorized in the following Fluid Balance Aggressive diuresis is often necessary in the management of COVID 19 patients This can lead to hypovolemia causing the body to decrease the glomerular filtration rate GFR to preserve fluid ARDS Side Effects The lung is one of the main sites of interest for the virus due to the abundance of ACE2 receptors on pneumocytes The inflammatory process in the lung results in an increased cytokine activity throughout the body Furthermore this can lead to increases in neurohormonal pathway activation in the sympathetic nervous system and the renin angiotensin aldosterone system while causing decreases in atrial natriuretic peptide ANP and brain natriuretic peptide BNP levels Altogether these effects have a harmful effect on GFR and cause inflammatory damage to renal vessels and parenchyma Hemodynamic The use of high positive end expiratory pressure PEEP in patients on ventilators can increase pressure in the thoracic cavity This can cause low pressure venous vessels with large blood carrying capacity to collapse under the pressure With less available volume in the thoracic venous vessels such as the superior and inferior vena cava venous blood will back up and cause conges tion in multiple organs including the kidney Furthermore the lower venous return to the heart will lead to decreased preload and cardiac output hence reduc ing the pressure in the renal arteries These two hemodynamic functions together cause a decrease in renal glomerular filtration pressure and can reduce GFR Hypoxemia and Hypercapnia The inability to properly oxygenate blood and offload carbon dioxide in the lungs can lead to chemical and acid base anoma lies which are harmful to the renal regulatory systems Hypoxemia on its own can reduce renal blood flow Carbon dioxide retention acidifies the blood forc ing the kidney to work harder to reabsorb bicarbonate and maintain physiologic pH This in turn increases the oxygen demand in the kidney Thus the kidney becomes particularly susceptible to hypoxic damage In addition hypercapnia has been known to cause a decrease in the renal autoregulatory system that maintains GFR and protects the kidney from hydrostatic pressure damage Rhabdomyolysis While not common there have been case reports and a few studies that have reported increases in myoglobin and creatine kinase levels in the blood of COVID 19 patients Direct Viral Infection Though unclear it has been suggested that the virus can directly infect the renal parenchyma This may be due to renal expression of the ACE2 surface protein which acts as a coreceptor for the viral entry of COVID 19 into the cell 97 As can be seen there are multiple possible etiologies for renal damage and AKI due to infection with COVID 19 There is evidence to support each of these etiolo gies so it is likely that they work in conjunction to unleash a multifaceted attack on the kidney 3 9 4 Monitoring COVID 19 Patients for AKI Due to the numerous possible ways that the kidney can be damaged from this virus it is important to keep a watchful eye on many parameters for patients with this diagnosis Recognizing AKI in COVID 19 is no different from recognizing it in other situations the American Society of Nephrology recommends using the well known KDIGO Kidney Disease Improving Global Guidelines 5 This involves con sistently monitoring parameters such as BUN serum creatinine and urine output 3 Beyond these direct parameters it is also important to monitor multiple values that may indicate an impending AKI 3 As there are many different possible etiolo gies of AKI as was explained earlier the parameters to monitor can be broken down by each etiology Fluid Balance It is recommended to assess the true volume status of each patient This should involve a multifaceted approach involving physical examination passive leg raise test pulse wave analysis point of care ultra sound and electrolyte levels Simply estimating the volume status from a few parameters can lead to false assessments of the fluid balance Efforts should be made to maintain the patient at euvolemia with normal electrolytes for best renal protection ARDS Side Effects High levels of cytokines and neurohormonal activity can cause damage to renal structure and function Thus it is important to monitor inflammatory markers and BNP to ensure early detection of abnormalities and swift response by the appropriate medical teams Hemodynamic As explained previously the hemodynamic effects of COVID 19 and its management can have deleterious effects on renal func tion It is therefore important to estimate or calculate the central venous pres sure CVP mean arterial pressure MAP cardiac output and renal perfusion pressure Without appropriate pressure in the renal vessels the kidneys will not be able to maintain the necessary GFR Calculating the volume status of the patient will also play a key role in understanding the hemodynamic status in this patient Furthermore patients on ventilators should be monitored for appropriate PEEP tidal volume and peak inspiratory pressures Concerns regarding these settings should be discussed with the appropriate teams to ensure the safest balance of ventilation and hemodynamics Hypoxemia and Hypercapnia The blood oxygen saturation is important to monitor in COVID 19 patients not only for the integrity of the lungs but also 98 Chapter 9 Renal Manifestations of COVID 19 Early Management of AKI for the kidneys Beyond just the saturation imbalance in oxygen and carbon dioxide levels can have many serious effects on kidney function so it is important to monitor parameters such as the arterial blood gases and the arte rial pH to assess the acid base status and gas exchange function of the patient Rhabdomyolysis Though this is a less common direct etiology of renal dam age the medical team can consider monitoring myoglobin and creatine kinase levels especially when there is a high suspicion of rhabdomyolysis Direct Viral Infection Evidence of direct viral infection of the kidney can occasionally be found on biopsy with immunofluorescence but this is not recommended as a monitoring strategy As can be seen the list of important parameters to monitor is quite vast A summary of these parameters as well as the corresponding pathophysiological importance is given in Table 9 1 Fortunately some of these parameters can be measured noninvasively while many of the invasive tests may provide an expanded value due to their importance to other organ systems beyond the kid ney While it may be especially difficult to find sufficient time to fully assess the patients regularly due to high patient load in a pandemic setting every effort should be made by all responsible teams to keep these etiologies in mind when considering each patient 3 9 5 Early Management of AKI While suspicion of kidney injury should prompt a discussion with a nephrology team it is important for all medical parties to understand the basic early manage ment of AKI The early management heavily depends on the adequate assessment of volume status as discussed earlier A combined approach using physical examina tion including assessment of edema weight changes and capillary refill passive leg raise test pulse wave analysis and point of care ultrasound is essential for assessing the true volume status beyond simple estimation from few parameters which is prone to error Once this is established the initial management goal should be to ensure that the patient is euvolemic Some evidence suggests the use of furo semide stress test to predict the progression of AKI However the evidence is lim ited and requires further study 3 It is important to stress here that the use or lack thereof of fluid reducing medi cations is vital for multiple organ systems in COVID 19 patients Therefore it is important that all teams responsible for the patient come to an understanding of what steps be taken in managing the patients prior to adding or removing medica tions However any member of the care team can carry out an assessment of the volume status which is a crucial step in deciding management Thus the primary team should initially focus on assessing this in order to facilitate the conversations between the multiple responsible medical teams 99 Table 9 1 Etiologies of Kidney Damage in COVID 19 Patients with Summarized Pathophysiology and Management Strategies Etiology Pathophysiology Monitoring Recommendation Fluid balance Aggressive diuresis during hospital management can cause iatrogenic hypovolemia ARDS side effects Hemodynamics Hypoxemia and hypercapnia Inflammation in the lung causes increased cytokine activity and activates the sympathetic nervous system and the renin angiotensin aldosterone system while decreasing ANP and BNP High PEEP causes decreased venous return This leads to backup of blood flow in the kidneys as well as lower perfusion due to decreased preload and cardiac output Decreased lung function causes hypoxemia hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis This has harmful effects on the renal regulatory system and it increases the energy demand of the kidney as it works to compensate for the acidosis Assess true volume status with physical examination passive leg raise test pulse wave analysis point of care ultrasound and electrolyte levels Maintain patient at euvolemia with normal electrolyte ranges Monitor inflammatory markers and BNP Estimate or calculate CVP MAP cardiac output and renal perfusion pressure Carefully monitor PEEP tidal volume and peak inspiratory pressures Maintain good communication with all teams responsible for ventilator adjustments Assess acid base status and gas exchange function with arterial blood gas pH and oxygen saturation Rhabdomyolysis COVID 19 patients have been reported to have increased serum myoglobin and creatine kinase levels Consider monitoring myoglobin and creatine kinase levels especially if there is high suspicion of rhabdomyolysis Direct viral infection Renal expression of ACE2 makes it theoretically possible for the virus to directly attack the kidney though this has not been fully studied No current monitoring recommendations 100 Chapter 9 Renal Manifestations of COVID 19 Note on ACE Inhibitor and ARB Usage in COVID 19 9 6 Note on Venous Thromboembolism VTE and Prophylaxis One of the concerns raised in COVID 19 patients was the presence of VTE that proved fatal However the evidence for this seems to be mainly from case studies and prelimi nary observational trials rather than robust large scale studies A single center cohort study from the University of Amsterdam was conducted with 198 hospitalized COVID patients 75 of which were admitted to the ICU The 21 day cumulative incidence of VTE was 42 The 21 day cumulative incidence of VTE was higher in the ICU 59 compared to the wards 9 2 6 These results add to the growing pool of evidence associating COVID 19 infection with VTE and different health care institutions have responded to this by devising their own protocols to provide adequate VTE prophylaxis to the patients Some of these protocols are based on D dimers and require the admin istration of heparin as a part of their prophylaxis guidelines Thus it is important to consider anticoagulation in COVID 19 patients and the monitoring and administration practices should be deferred to hospital protocols and case by case analysis 3 A study in Tongji Hospital in Wuhan China retrospectively analyzed the 28 day mortality between heparin and nonheparin users among severe COVID 19 patients It was concluded that anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin was asso ciated with a better prognosis in patients who met the sepsis induced coagulopathy criteria with increased levels of D dimers 7 This study can be considered when devising an appropriate protocol for anticoagulation 9 7 Note on ACE Inhibitor and ARB Usage in COVID 19 The use of medications such as ACEIs and ARBs has been shown in some animal trials to increase the expression of the ACE2 receptor Given that the COVID 19 virus uses ACE2 as a coreceptor to enter the cells there is a concern that the use of these medica tions may increase susceptibility to the infection ACE2 is present in various body viscera such as kidneys heart gastrointestinal system and type II alveolar cells in the lungs 8 The role of ACE2 in the healthy body is to convert angiotensin II into angioten sin 1 7 which has a vasodilatory effect that is protective in various lung injury mod els Evidence suggests that angiotensin 1 7 prevents oxidative stress and also plays a role in controlling inflammation and fibrosis in the renal tissues and beyond In a trial involving rats it was found that angiotensin 1 7 modulates the vascular responses to vasoconstrictors and prevents nitric oxide induced oxidative stress 9 Thus it is cur rently unknown whether ACE inhibitors or ARBs are beneficial or harmful during COVID 19 infection The current recommendation is for patients taking ACE inhibi tors or ARBs to continue their regimen However the Randomized Elimination or ProLongation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in Coronavirus Disease 2019 REPLACE COVID trial is currently underway at the University of Pennsylvania which will investigate the effects of temporarily stopping these medications in patients hospitalized with COVID 19 10 101 9 8 Conclusion The development of AKI in COVID 19 patients increases the risk of mortality Monitoring kidney function should be monitored with BUN creatinine and urine output Assessment of volume status and maintenance of euvolemia is an essential man agement step Fluid reducing medicines should be used with caution to avoid AKI Measuring inflammatory markers and BNP can assess the level of systemic inflammation Adequate VTE prophylaxis either using heparin or using other anticoagulating agent should be considered for hospitalized patients ACEIs and ARBs should be used with care as the efficacy of these medicines in COVID 19 patients is poorly understood RRT is recommended for patients who can no longer be managed on medications References 1 Li Z et al Caution

Diabetic ketoacidosis Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 Erythrocyte sedimentation rate Glucagon like peptide 1 Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 Type 2 diabetes 10 1 Overview Worldwide over 400 million are affected by diabetes with over 1 6 million deaths attributable to diabetes alone in 2016 1 In the United States in 2018 10 5 of the population had diabetes which is the seventh leading cause of death 2 Diabetes is a multiorgan disease and leads to worse outcomes in many other diseases when it is a comorbid condition Previous viral outbreaks have shown us that diabetes is a very important risk factor to consider Diabetes was associated with poor outcomes dur ing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV 1 outbreak in the early 2000s3 and the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 and was associated with more severe infection and a higher mortality rate during the Middle East respiratory syn drome coronavirus MERS CoV outbreak in 2012 4 Currently diabetes is the third most common comorbidity in COVID 19 patients 5 is associated with more severe disease 6 and increases patients risk of ICU 103 admission 7 8 Most notable however are diabetes and obesity that are both indepen dently associated with a higher risk of death in COVID 19 patients 8 In light of these data and by understanding the data from previous viral outbreaks it is imperative to understand the interaction between this viral pandemic and the global epidemic of diabetes 10 2 Mechanisms of Increased COVID 19 Severity in Diabetic Patients In general diabetic patients are more susceptible to infection due to dysfunctional immune responses such as decreased neutrophil chemotaxis and decreased phago cytosis by the innate immune cells 9 11 Immune cell function like killing via respira tory burst is also inhibited by hyperglycemia seen in diabetic patients 11 Diabetic patients have decreased proportions of CD4 CD8 and anti inflammatory regula tory T cells and also have a higher proportion of pro inflammatory immune cells eg Th17 cells 11 This altered immune landscape may allow inflammatory cascades to go unchecked in diabetic patients There is also evidence that patients with hyper tension and diabetes have a delayed clearance of viral load prolonging infections 10 With respect to SARS CoV 2 specifically it is theorized that diabetes increases the risk of infection due to up regulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE2 which the virus uses to infect cells 9 10 The effects of diabetes on ACE2 are twofold While acute hyperglycemia has been shown to up regulate ACE2 there is evidence that chronic hyperglycemia down regulates ACE2 expression This effect of ACE2 down regulation may how ever increase the inflammatory damage caused by COVID 19 as ACE2 is protec tive against inflammation 9 Diabetic patients also have increased levels of plasmin and plasminogen and protease enzymes thought to play a role in SARS CoV 2 infectivity Plasmin ogen cleaves furin sites in SARS CoV 2 S proteins which increases infectivity by allowing easier entry fusion duplication and release of viral particles in respiratory cells Elevated plasmin ogen and furin levels are com mon in COVID 19 diabetes and may also be an independent factor for risk stratifi cation 11 Another way diabetes exacerbates COVID 19 symptoms is its effects on the respiratory system Diabetes can cause altered lung capillary permeability and small airway collapse Additionally SARS CoV 2 can decrease the O2 carrying capacity of hemoglobin which is exacerbated in the glycated hemoglobin in dia betic patients 11 Not only does diabetes exacerbate the symptoms of COVID 19 COVID 19 also exacerbates the symptoms of diabetes A study of 658 patients in Wuhan China showed that 6 4 presented with ketosis and these patients had worse outcomes and longer hospital stays In a smaller proportion of patients this ketosis precipi tated into diabetic ketoacidosis DKA which is a serious complication of diabetes Interestingly of the five total DKA cases two of the patients were nondiabetic 12 A 104 Chapter 10 Endocrine Manifestations of COVID 19 Managing Diabetes in COVID Patients case study in Singapore also showed DKA precipitated by COVID 19 13 The mech anism of COVID 19 induced DKA is unclear however it is postulated that direct damage to pancreatic beta cells due to infection causes an acute insulin deficiency that can precipitate DKA 9 13 10 3 Managing Diabetes in COVID Patients Management of glycemia is of utmost importance in COVID 19 patients Data from an Italian study shows that diabetic patients with hyperglycemia are at a higher risk of developing severe COVID 19 and have persistently higher levels of inflammation measured by IL 6 and D dimer than diabetic patients who are normoglycemic Data from a retrospective study in Hubei Province China shows that maintenance of glycemia within 3 9 10 mmol L in patients with preexisting type 2 diabetes T2D is associated with a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality 14 Glycemia in T2D patients may be managed by a plethora of medications which may have implications for SARS CoV 2 infection Because ACE2 is important for viral entry into cells upregulation of ACE2 may be detrimental Several classes of diabetes medications may be implicated in this sodium glucose cotransporter 2 SGLT 2 inhibitors glucagon like peptide 1 GLP 1 receptor antagonists piogli tazones and possibly insulin 15 Most notable however are the ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ARB Preclinical models indicate that ACE2 may be up regulated by ACE inhibitors ARBs raising concerns for their use in COVID 19 patients However new clinical data indicates that their use is safe and effective in COVID 19 patients 16 An additional consideration when choosing medications is the involvement of inflammation in the COVID 19 disease process Dipeptidyl pep tidase 4 DPP4 which is involved in inflammatory pathways is the target of incre tin based therapies used for T2D Preclinical studies show a decreased inflammation with DPP4 inhibition and similar effects are seen with SGLT 2 inhibitors and pio glitazone 15 raising the question whether these therapies would be more appropriate for use in diabetic COVID patients It must be noted that currently there have been no changes in guidelines for managing diabetes in COVID 19 patients Furthermore there is no evidence of poor outcomes when treating diabetic patients with any of the abovementioned medications 17 which are summarized in Table 10 1 adapted from Pal et al 2020 In the inpatient setting insulin infusion may be the best method for achieving gly cemic targets and improving outcomes due to its safety and reliability 18 However other factors must be considered when treating an infectious disease namely reduction of contact with COVID positive patients Therefore physicians must choose a regimen that fits their primary target glycemic control vs contact fre quency For instance if the physician wishes to reduce contact they may use an NPH regular regimen 19 Such pros and cons are listed in Table 10 2 adapted from Hamdy et al 19 105 Table 10 1 Commonly Prescribed Antidiabetic Drugs and Concerns Regarding Their Use during COVID 19 Antidiabetic Drug Data from Animal Studies Data from Human Studies Insulin Metformin Sulfonylureas Pioglitazone Reduces renal ADAM 17 expression in diabetic mice thereby reducing

epidemic employs an immunoevasive technique wherein it knocks down the host cortisol stress response It does so by mimicking amino acid sequences of host adrenocorticotrophic hor mone ACTH Because SARS CoV 2 is related to SARS CoV it is theorized that COVID 19 may affect the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal HPA axis There are currently prospective studies underway to analyze this 20 107 Independently of COVID 19 s effects on the HPA axis glucocorticoids have been employed to treat the cytokine storm which causes many of COVID 19 s worst symptoms Those with adrenal insufficiency should be treated with dou ble the dose of glucocorticoids according to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists 20 21 For patients with adrenal insufficiency and COVID 19 presenting persistent fever or severe pneumonias the preferred treatment is an initial bolus of 50 100 mg hydrocortisone followed by a con tinuous IV replacement This regimen reduces the immunosuppressive effects of high peaks of hydrocortisone and has been shown to reduce time in the ICU 21 22 10 4 2 Subacute Thyroiditis Subacute thyroiditis is an inflammatory thyroid disease which is generally pre cipitated by a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract The first reported case of subacute thyroiditis after SARS CoV 2 infection has been confirmed in Italy Fifteen days after testing positive for SARS CoV 2 via oropharyngeal swab the patient presented with tachycardia and an inflamed and painful thy roid FT4 and FT3 were high in this patient with an undetectable TSH and negative TPOAb and TRAb High FT4 and FT3 indicate hyperthyroidism while negative thyroid antibodies indicate a non autoimmune etiology Inflammatory markers such as C reactive protein CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR were high along with white blood cell count After treatment with pred nisone for over one month the symptoms resolved and both inflammatory mark ers and thyroid tests were normal 23 This case represents another clinical manifestation of COVID 19 that should not be overlooked especially by endocrinologists 10 5 Telemedicine Diabetes is a disease which requires a careful management and communication between patients and providers During a pandemic this communication is dif ficult highlighting a need to turn towards telemedicine in order to manage patients Two cases of new onset type 1 diabetes in Colorado one adult and one pediatric highlight the effectiveness of telemedicine 24 The adult patient used multiple daily insulin injections and the pediatric patient used a continuous insulin pump Both patients used continuous glucose monitoring software Dexcom Clarity and Glooko By following up with the patient s glucose moni toring online and checking in with them via e mail Zoom video conferencing and telephone calls both patients have been effectively managed during the pandemic 24 108 Chapter 10 Endocrine Manifestations of COVID 19 Conclusion In India a review of telemedicine guidelines suggests that it is an important tool to use in managing chronic conditions like diabetes 25 However more research should be done on the long term impact of telemedicine on health outcomes The authors caution that because telemedicine cannot replace the physical examination at least the first consult should be in person 25 10 6 Tools for Health Care Providers 1

manifestations of COVID 19 Some of the manifestations that have been reported are chilblain lesions erythematous rashes skin lesions due to the hypercoagulable state of COVID 19 livedo reticularis like eruptions exanthematous drug eruptions or maculopapular rashes digitate papulo squamous eruptions and petechiae There have been a series of cases where suspected COVID 19 patients presented with reddish and papular lesions that seemingly resemble chilblains Figures 11 1 11 4 1 These lesions were seen in all age ranges but mainly in children with a Figure 11 1 Chilblain lesions on toes and heel 1 a b Figure 11 2 a Papular lesions on heel b Same lesions a week later 1 116 Chapter 11 Dermatological Manifestations of COVID 19 Clinical Manifestations Figure 11 3 Acral lesion with crust 1 Figure 11 4 Erythematous lesions 1 median age of 13 years and young adults with a median age of 31 After 1 week these lesions were found to become more purpuric and flattened They eventually disappeared without intervention Some patients reported the lesions to be painful when palpated however they were not very symptomatic These lesions were dis covered to be mainly located on the toes soles fingers extremities and or heel but are commonly referred to as COVID toes Figure 11 5 1 117 Figure 11 5 Erythematous violaceous lesions in the toe 1 The patients were asymptomatic but some reported contact with suspected or infected COVID 19 patients 1 Two of the patients had a positive diagnosis of coro navirus The chilblain like lesions could possibly be a late manifestation of COVID 19 In order to verify if the lesions are related to COVID 19 it is recommended to do a biopsy of them and to possibly perform a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT PCR test along with an IgM IgG serological test on patients These to diagnose COVID 19 patients who are asymptomatic 1 lesions can also help In a study of 88 COVID 19 patients in Italy 20 4 of patients had skin involve ment during the viral infection The lesions were characterized as an erythematous rash in 14 patients widespread urticaria in three patients and chickenpox like ves icles in one patient The eruptions were primarily located on patients trunks and there was little to no associated itching with the lesions The eruptions were present only for a few days before resolving spontaneously 2 These types of exanthems are commonly seen in many other viral infections such as measles and mononucleosis In addition to these viral infection associated exanthems there have been some reports of skin lesions that are likely due to the hypercoagulable state that many COVID 19 patients are in 3 A few cases of a livedo reticularis like rash have been reported The patients lesions are described as lacy and purple with no associated itching These eruptions resolved within 24 h in most patients 4 Livedo reticularis normally occurs due to the interruption of blood flow that leads to deoxygenated blood pooling in the cutane ous venous plexus 5 If such a livedo reticularis like rash is occurring in COVID 19 patients this raises concern for the interruption of blood flow to other organs in addition to the skin In fact one of the COVID 19 patients who was reported to have the livedo reticularis like rash also had hematuria This may have been due to the 118 Chapter 11 Dermatological Manifestations of COVID 19 Clinical Manifestations interruption of the kidney s blood supply resulting in glomerulonephritis or cysti tis 5 Thus it is important for clinicians treating patients with this kind of skin erup tion to be wary of other possible symptoms of hypercoagulability Another possible viral manifestation of COVID 19 is exanthematous drug erup tion or morbilliform drug eruption Figure 11 6 6 This immune reaction is charac terized by erythematous macules and or papules that are usually seen in patients with bacterial and viral infections and about 5 days to 3 weeks after the administra tion of certain drugs such as antivirals anti hypertensives anti inflammatory medi cations and antibiotics However this condition is mostly seen after administering antiviral medications Due to the use of lopinavir ritonavir drug combinations in combating the coronavirus there have been reports of an increase in maculopapular drug eruptions In one example a 35 year old positively infected coronavirus patient was diagnosed with optic neuritis a week before he was admitted to the hospital He did not present with any symptoms and reported no history of international travel or exposure to infected COVID 19 patients or patients suspected of having COVID 19 6 The patient was isolated in the hospital s COVID 19 unit and treated with oral lopinavir ritonavir 400 100 BID for 10 days Subsequently the patient presented with an itchy maculopapular eruption during his hospitalization These were initially and mainly seen on the skin of the trunk and eventually spread to upper extremities after 24 h The patient reported to have had no history of contact dermatitis drug reactions or other hypersensitivity reactions 6 In order to treat the morbilliform eruption dermatologists administered an increased dose of systemic corticosteroids and began corticosteroid topical treatment along with systemic antihistamines At the 10 day follow up there was no evidence of the patient s skin lesions a b Figure 11 6 a b Morbilliform eruption observed on the trunk and neck These manifestations are primarily seen on the skin of the trunk 6 119 There is some speculation that there could be a direct association between mor billiform eruptions and COVID 19 infection Furthermore an example showing this link was observed in the data collected by dermatologists analyzing skin lesions in 88 Italian COVID 19 patients This data reflected that about one fifth of patients developed maculopapular eruptions Figure 11 7 6 There was also no correlation between the COVID 19 infection severity and the cutaneous findings Although there are some reports of morbilliform eruptions seen in COVID 19 patients who were taking antiviral medications such as lopinavir and ritonavir there is no cer tainty that this type of presentation is only caused by medications 6 There is suspi cion that COVID 19 may be another factor for the morbilliform eruptions that were observed But the association needs to be examined through further research 6 b a c Figure 11 7 a Erythematous squamous lesions with periumbilical patch and lesions on the abdomen and thighs b Skin lesions on the left upper arm and flank 7 c Spongiosis in the epider mis and spongiotic vesicles with aggregates of lymphocytes and Langerhans cells 7 120 Chapter 11 Dermatological Manifestations of COVID 19 Clinical Manifestations A case of digitate papulosquamous eruption was reported during a SARS CoV 2 infection Figure 11 8 7 The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for acute respiratory distress The patient was diagnosed with COVID 19 through a nasopharyngeal SARS CoV 2 RT PCR The patient developed a squamous and erythematous periumbilical patch and was later seen to have a rapid progression of other similar digitate scaly thin plaques laterally on the trunk and thighs Papular lesions were found on the upper arms shoulders and back A skin biopsy of the left shoulder showed spongiotic vesicles with aggregates of lymphocytes and Langerhans cells RT PCR was performed on the skin biopsy and was nega tive for SARS CoV 2 The patient tested positive for Epstein Barr virus EBV through a blood test The eruption resolved spontaneously within 1 week how ever the patient eventually died of COVID 19 related illness It was concluded that the cutaneous rash could be a secondary result of the immune response against the coronavirus as there was no evidence of a cutaneous drug reaction to cefpo doxime EBV was not suspected to have caused the cutaneous findings although EBV was found to be reactivated 7 A case of petechiae was reported during the COVID 19 outbreak in Madrid Spain A 48 year old man with hypertension presented to the emergency department where he reported a fever chest pain and shortness of breath sev eral days before hospital admission Three days after the onset of fever he noticed the appearance of pruritic skin lesions Petechiae was seen in a sym metric distribution on the buttocks popliteal fossae proximal anterior thighs and lower abdomen Figure 11 8 8 A nasopharyngeal swab RT PCR was per formed and resulted in a positive diagnosis for SARS CoV 2 for this patient Serologic test results were negative for HIV hepatitis B virus hepatitis C virus and parvovirus B19 8 a b c Figure 11 8 Erythematous macules papules and petechiae affecting the popliteal fossa but tocks and anterior thighs a Posteroinferior view b Close up view of the buttocks c Anterior view 8 121 11 3 PPE Usage Impact on Patients Although not a direct pathophysiologic effect of the virus many COVID 19 patients have developed dermatologic issues simply due to increased PPE usage and exten sive personal hygiene measures 9 The resultant friction due to consistent PPE utili zation along with the hyper hydration effects of PPE can result in notable skin lesions Erythema and scaling have been observed along with burning stinging and itching Lesions are primarily found on the face due to face masks with some lesions on the hands due to glove use Many individuals have amplified personal hygiene measures by washing their hands several times a day which can result in hand dermatitis Figure 11 9 9 In one extreme case a woman washed her face with 60 ethanol five times per day and wore a face mask for 6 h per day two measures which resulted in facial redness and papules Figure 11 10 9 Figure 11 9 Hand dermatitis from excessive hand washing 9 a b Figure 11 10 Facial erythema and papules in a 42 year old female patient who disinfected her face with 60 ethanol and used a protective facial mask for 6 h per day 9 122 Chapter 11 Dermatological Manifestations of COVID 19 References 11 4 PPE Usage Impact on Health care Workers Health care workers in particular are uniquely susceptible to PPE related skin lesions due to the amount of time during which they must wear face masks gloves etc With N95 masks in particular many health care workers report increased acne dermatitis and facial itching 10 Recurrent use of lipid emulsifying detergents that diminish lipids in the stratum corneum layer of the skin can cause skin dryness Hand sanitizers can also compromise the stratum corneum layer of the skin due to the lipid dissolving alcohols 10 In order to combat dermatologic reactions to PPE usage and personal hygiene it is recommended to moisturize the skin and avoid allergens found in disinfectant products containing quaternary ammonium 10 The most efficient method to combat adverse cutaneous reactions from hygiene practices is to regularly utilize oil con taining emollients after handwashing In a randomized double blind trial of health care workers who all presented with severe hand irritation it was seen that the scheduled use of oil containing lotion was better than creams for improving skin scaling cracking and pain in the hands 10 It would be beneficial for dermatologists to promote protective methods during the pandemic such as proper hand washing procedures avoiding washing hands with hot water to reduce the possibility of having skin damage avoiding antibac terial soaps due to them not being superior to non antibacterial soaps in prevent ing infections avoiding chemicals in soaps to reduce the possibility of having allergic reactions utilizing a 60 alcohol based hand sanitizer on hands for 20 s if soap and water are unavailable avoiding sanitizers containing fragrances to reduce allergic skin reactions and avoiding a direct skin contact with EPA registered disinfectant products by wearing gloves and cleaning hands afterward to prevent allergic skin reactions 10 Furthermore oil emollient moisturizers to the hands after handwashing can be regularly applied to combat skin damage induced by allergens 10 References 1 Landa N Mendieta Eckert M

syndrome coronavirus 2 12 1 Introduction COVID 19 has changed how ophthalmologists are running their practices and treat ing their patients This chapter shares the latest information on the ophthalmological manifestation of COVID 19 and its impact on patients and health care providers 12 2 Conjunctivitis The most common and only ophthalmic manifestation of the SARS CoV 2 virus reported is conjunctivitis 1 Conjunctivitis can present as a first or only sign of infection from SARS CoV 2 All the reports of conjunctivitis associated with SARS CoV 2 have been bilateral mild follicular conjunctivitis without corneal involvement with some exceptions 1 Although initially believed to be a rare mani festation conjunctivitis is now being believed to be a primary symptom of the SARS CoV 2 infection 2 According to an AAAS study The estimated proportion of those with ocular symptoms some consistent with conjunctivitis ranges widely for Disease Control and Prevention Coronavirus from 1 2019 Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network to more than 30 sug gesting that conjunctivitis could be a disease feature and potentially a useful diag nostic sign 3 Centers 125 12 3 Precautions 12 3 1 Personal Protective Equipment PPE To protect against SARS CoV 2 during regular office visits ophthalmologists are recommended by the American Academy of Ophthalmology to continue using the proper disinfecting practices of instruments and offices using bleach and alcohol based disinfectants before and after every patient encounter 1 Although there is no documented evidence that SAR CoV 2 can be transmitted via ocular secretions it may be possible to contract COVID 19 from a COVID 19 patient who has conjunctivitis 1 Precautions should still be taken such as having one s eyes mouth and nose protected using goggles or N95 mask as well as slit lamp breath shields1 12 3 2 Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine Regarding the usage of the drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in response to the COVID 19 pandemic the American Academy of Ophthalmology warns against the potential of developing irreversible maculopathy if these drugs are taken in high doses over short periods of time 1 12 4 Testing Several of the reports of such patients also demonstrated that these patients tested positive for SARS CoV 2 by detecting its mRNA on RT PCR on conjunctival swabs 1 One patient tested positive for SARS CoV 2 by culturing the virus from an eye swab 1 Expression of mRNA for ACE has been seen in conjunctival epithelial cells as demonstrated in studies by Zou et al 4 and Sungnak et al 5 One study pur ported to show that SARS CoV 2 could infect human conjunctival explants how ever its presence in conjunctival epithelium remains controversial Table 12 1 1 12 5 Conclusion The key takeaways from an ophthalmological point are as follows Patients presenting with conjunctivitis should be tested for COVID 19 Patients with COVID 19 may present with conjunctivitis as the only manifes tation of COVID 19 Those performing eye examinations should use appropriate PPE such as masks gloves and gowns 126 Chapter 12 Ophthalmological Manifestations of COVID 19 Conclusion Table 12 1 Major

respiratory syndrome 13 1 Introduction One unexplored visible impact of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 is on the mental health of people patients their loved ones and the general public under nationwide lockdowns Everyone is affected whether directly or indirectly high lighting the massive impact the pandemic has had socially economically and psy chologically The focus of this chapter is on the psychological crisis facing people and specific populations such as health care workers patients with underlying mental health disturbances and patients with COVID 19 This chapter will close with the recommended next steps in addressing current and new issues that may arise 13 2 Pandemics in History and Psychological Impacts As noted earlier see Chapter 7 COVID 19 can potentially have multiple effects on the central nervous system CNS But the impact and the full scope of effects are not yet well known including how long they may last Recently more evidence is coming out calling for greater mental health impacts and interventions to address the new gaps in care This section reviews the history of pandemics and psychologi cal impacts 131 Over the course of human history human beings have dealt with many mass disastrous events including natural disasters famine disease and war just to men tion a few These have had innumerable effects on the societies it affected all the way from the individual to the population level Epidemics and pandemics in par ticular have played significant roles in human history as evidenced by the Bubonic plague of the Middle Ages and the Spanish flu outbreak of the early 1900s Within this century we have already had four major disease outbreaks that have signifi cantly affected the human populace the severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS epidemic of 2003 the H1N1 epidemic of 2009 the Ebola epidemic in 2014 and now the COVID 19 pandemic There is a significant body of research that has come out from prior epidem ics in this century on the significant effects the epidemics had on mental health at many levels including those who became sick the health care workers caring for them and the population at large Published literature after the SARS epi demic which affected more than 8000 people resulted in 774 deaths world wide and spread to over 30 countries showed an increased prevalence of persistent psychological symptoms even months to years after the epidemic had ceased 1 5 During the SARS epidemic higher rates of completed suicide by older adult were reported and attributed to possibly social isolation and increased stress and anxiety among the elderly in Hong Kong 6 8 In addition high rates of psychosocial disturbances such as insomnia depression anxiety and post trau matic stress disorder PTSD were reported among those who had survived but also in their family members 9 Several studies documented substantial psycho logical distress in health care workers caring for SARS patients even years after the event 1 10 11 These results are reflected not only in the literature seen after the other epidemics of this century but also after significant trauma and disasters 12 There are two important psychosocial distinctions from general disasters and disease epidemics the consequences of social isolation and the fear of spreading the contagion if exposed 10 Quarantines while a necessary part of disease prevention and mitigation have serious and long lasting effects on the mental health of those affected This was the case when entire cities and villages were quarantined and public health measures were put in place in China and Canada and West Africa dur ing the SARS and Ebola outbreaks respectively 13 Furthermore the absence of social support offering protection during times of stress exacerbates psychological trauma Fear complicated by mistrust misinformation and the policies that impacted on the regions cultural and religious beliefs has been a strong motivator This can lead to an exponential rise in certain fear related behaviors that were intended to be that of survival but instead led to increased risk During the Ebola outbreak for example the health care system highlighted frailties and led to perceived low quality care and lack of trust leading to harbor and manage loved ones in their own homes 14 132 Chapter 13 Mental Health Manifestations of COVID 19 Effects on Different Populations 13 3 Effects on Different Populations A variety of mental health and psychological factors similar to those that have been seen historically are expected to occur during and after the current COVID 19 pandemic 15 19 However unlike in those disease outbreaks COVID 19 has strained the entire world and has put a lot of stress on many countries The mental health exacerbations that may be seen now and after are not only due to the similar fears and anxieties evoked by the pandemic itself but also due to the overwhelming stress this pandemic has placed on the health care system as a whole Countries such as China USA Italy Iran and several others that were hit the hardest are finding their populations experiencing psychological distress including health care workers immigrant populations the elderly those with underlying mental illness and many more groups Thus it is crucial to understand now who may be at risk for psycho logical distress and where mental health services need to be directed 13 3 1 Mental Health in Patients with COVID 19 One population at risk for mental health distress is the patient who contracts COVID 19 As mentioned before the fears of spreading the disease and the subse quent social isolation places those who are exposed and who contract COVID 19 under tremendous emotional strain In some instances COVID 19 patients need intensive care unit ICU level care which creates psychological distress One study from New York found that of those requiring hospitalization 14 2 were treated in the ICU and 12 2 received invasive mechanical ventilation 20 ICU level care on its own can create psychological distress For example nearly 20 of patients leav ing an adult critical care exhibited PTSD which in turn was related to a higher likelihood of persistent sleep disturbances 21 22 A non COVID 19 study reported that patients admitted to intensive care with acute respiratory distress syndrome anxiety depression and PTSD occurred at high levels during the 2 year follow up period with relatively low rate of remission of symptoms 23 Subsequently those who had been exposed to disease or who may have gotten sick from it have been subject to ostracization and xenophobia if geographical link ages have been placed to the epidemic leading to increased fear and anxiety among survivors about reintegrating back into society 24 Thus it is important to take a mul tidisciplinary approach to treating patients with COVID 19 to ensure the best qual ity care that addresses the mental health needs of the patient as well 13 3 2 Psychological Health in Patients with Mental Illness Patients with mental illness are one of the most vulnerable groups due to a degree of stigmatization they receive and the degree of deprivation they encounter this encompasses other factors such as poverty poor lifestyle factors environment and 133 unemployment A number of stressors that include quarantine isolation hardship and the lack of psychosocial approaches to alleviate and optimize their mental health can have negative effects on their mental health Inpatient psychiatric care and management can be complicated by the lack of movement liberty and possible bereavement for patients Community based care is likely to have very limited face to face consultations and reduced care contact is likely to negatively impact a patient s mental health and their concordance The challenge to pharmacological management becomes increasingly impor tant during coronavirus The Royal College of Psychiatrists in the United Kingdom has set out clear channels of support for patients and their carers as well as approaches clinicians should consider 25 The rates of electroconvulsive therapy for example a very effective approach to manage certain severe mental illnesses has fallen in some parts of the world 26 The presence of psychiatric medications in a patient who becomes positive for COVID 19 requires specialist attention to ensure their respiratory and cardiovascular health is not compro mised Sedation respiratory depression electrocardiogram ECG changes and delirium are some of considerations that will need to be taken into account People with dementia are at greater risk of suffering from delirium and their aftercare needs as well as of those with other mental illnesses are paramount for their rehabilitation Those that are hospitalized and those that require intensive care will need an approach that covers physical social and psychological needs to optimize their well being 13 3 3 Psychological Health in Health Care Workers Another high risk population for psychological distress is the health care workers themselves The very nature of health care work and the high pressure and stress situations health care workers find themselves in have been known to be psycho logically taxing with deleterious consequences to their mental health for quite some time now In disease outbreaks the psychological stress and toll it takes is ampli fied Health care workers are already a high risk group for suicide and mental health disorders in particular female physicians and physicians in the United States being found to be at higher risk in a review 27 28 One study had found that emergency phy sicians in the United States were found to have higher rates of PTSD 29 Other health care workers like nurses are also found to be at higher risk of sui cide and mental health disturbances 30 32 There is evidence within the nursing pro fession in the United Kingdom for example that rates among female nurses are much higher and female health professionals in general are 24 more likely than the national average female 33 During the SARS outbreak for example multiple investigations were released on the prevalence of mental health disorders in health care workers and they found significantly higher rates of post traumatic stress and psychological disturbances even years after the epidemic was declared over 10 11 Similar findings were reported in health care workers who had worked though the Ebola epidemic 18 134 Chapter 13 Mental Health Manifestations of COVID 19 Next Steps Many have come out warning of the coming psychological impact this pandemic will have on health care workers and it is important to remember this group as already a high risk group for mental disturbances and so appropriate measures should be taken to address the mental health needs of the health care working com munity 34 35 Two health care workers in New York City committed suicide from COVID 19 related stress 36 13 3 4 Psychological Health in the General Population The wide ranging impact of this pandemic will affect almost everyone be it directly or indirectly in ways we may not yet have anticipated Those with preexisting men tal health issues who are themselves at risk for poorer physical health outcomes and may be at higher risk of contracting COVID 19 and faring worse than the general population are themselves at high risk for psychological distress and at risk for exacerbating their underlying mental health issues be it due to limited access to medications and providers or due to the effects of social isolation from quarantine 37 38 Mental health resources before the pandemic were already limited in many coun tries and now as more people become affected and are affected on a psychosocial level those mental health resources will be stretched thin further On top of all that the massive economic impact of this outbreak by itself can lead to massive psychological trauma as many citizens have lost their jobs are unable to buy supplies and are unable to pay their bills affecting individuals in all age groups on many levels There is a great risk of increased alcohol and substance misuse dur ing such times of economic strain which in turn can lead to increased prevalence of intimate partner violence and domestic abuse 39 40 Another study on alcoholism was conducted at USC showed the spurt in alcohol sales up to 55 in late March 41 which in turn can affect childhood psychological well being and is associated with long term psychiatric distress 42 Holt 2008 In areas of the world with recent histories of disasters there is already a higher rate of PTSD anxiety and more psy chological disturbance than can and will be exacerbated by this pandemic 43 44 With already a high prevalence of mental health disorders around the world this pan demic will further worsen the mental health crises that already exist unless we prop erly anticipate and tackle these issues now 13 4 Next Steps Considering the severe impact this pandemic has had and will have on the mental health of so many it is important to create next steps on how to tackle the parallel epidemic of mental health illnesses We have already seen a great response that comes from the expedited implementation and use of virtual technologies specifi cally telemedicine to continue to provide physical and mental health care ser vices 45 47 However these technologies have their limitations especially when it comes to access to smartphone or broadband technology services as is seen in the 135 United States 48 Often the populations who need these services the most have the lowest amount of access to these technologies and services so special attention needs to be paid in making these resources available to our most vulnerable popula tions during such a strenuous time 49 In addition the role of research cannot be underestimated as we try to move past this pandemic and learn from it 45 Many areas for potential research exist such as assessing the access to and examining the effectiveness of virtual technology services for providing mental health services evaluating the psychological impact this pan demic has had on survivors health care workers and the general population at large and many more possibilities The important thing is to have learned as much as we can from this pandemic to be able to best respond to the next crisis whatever that may be 13 4 1 What you can do Syed Ashraf Imam PhD Clinical Psychologist The adverse condition of social isolation and loneliness amid this pandemic around the

reactive protein Erythrocyte sedimentation rate Gastrointestinal infection Invasive bacterial infection Intensive care unit Interleukin 10 Immunoglobulin M Polymerase chain reaction Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome temporally associated Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 14 1 Overview The data available at this time demonstrates clear and important differences in coro navirus disease 2019 COVID 19 infection in children versus adults It has been shown that COVID 19 affects pediatric patients less frequently than the adult popu lation and when infection takes place the disease is milder and the prognosis is better In the United States from February 12 to April 2 2020 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC gathered data reports that only 1 7 of COVID positive patients were children aged 18 years 1 This is reassuring to pediatricians because in fact 22 of the US population is 18 years old 2 Additionally of the COVID positive children in the United States about half 49 were in the age 143 range of 10 17 the median age was 11 years and 15 of positive children were infants 1 year 1 Also of note 91 of these pediatric patients had exposure to a COVID 19 patient in the household or community 1 14 2 Clinical Manifestations Just as the infectivity differs in the pediatric community so too do the clinical mani festations The most common presenting symptoms in children were cough and fever but at a less frequent rate than in adults In the aforementioned CDC report 73 of COVID pediatric patients had symptoms of fever cough or shortness of breath which is less than the 93 of adults aged 18 64 years who presented with these symptoms during the same period 1 This goes to show that children may be COVID positive and shedding the virus but only display mild cold symptoms con gestion rhinorrhea sneezing without cough and fever In fact available data from China suggests that pediatric patients may have more upper respiratory tract mani festations and nasopharyngeal carriage as opposed to lower respiratory tract involvement 3 Therefore it may be even more important for children to social dis tance during this pandemic because of the insidious and mild nature of COVID 19 illness in this age group especially when coupled with the fact that children typi cally have undeveloped personal hygiene habits Other symptoms that providers should be aware of in children include pharyn geal erythema which was present in 46 of pediatric cases in Wuhan Children s Hospital4 as well as fatigue conjunctivitis diarrhea and vomiting In fact some children presented only with gastrointestinal symptoms 5 The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal reports that children have been shown to have gastrointestinal infection GI complaints in up to 57 of human coronavirus infections including COVID 19 which is more common than in adults 6 As mentioned the prognosis also seems to differ for children Available data in the United States shows that 5 7 20 of COVID positive children were hospital ized 1 Ostensibly this is a lower rate than adults aged 18 64 years of whom 10 33 of COVID positive patients were hospitalized 1 Intensive care unit ICU admis sions were also less in the pediatric world 0 58 2 0 children versus 1 4 4 5 adults 1 This is all to say that infected children seem to have a more mild presenta tion and clinical course In fact most children will recover within 1 2 weeks from symptom onset 4 This being said the age of the child potentially has an impact on the prognosis Initial Chinese data shows somewhat of a trend between severity of disease with younger age The widely referenced study from Dong et al a series of over 2000 children with suspected or confirmed COVID 19 reported that the proportion of severe and critical cases was 10 6 7 3 4 2 4 1 and 3 0 for the age group of 1 1 5 6 10 11 15 and 16 years respectively 5 Therefore closer follow up and management is warranted of younger children with particular attention to infants 1 year 144 Chapter 14 Pediatric Manifestations of COVID 19 Newborn and Infant Considerations Likewise special attention is necessary for children with underlying medical conditions The CDC details that among 345 children with confirmed COVID 19 and data on underlying conditions 23 had at least one comorbidity most com monly moderate to severe asthma cardiovascular disease immunosuppression diabetes and severe obesity with BMI 40 kg m2 1 This CDC report also states Among the 295 pediatric cases for which information on both hospitalization sta tus and underlying medical conditions was available 28 of 37 77 hospitalized patients including all six patients admitted to an ICU had one or more underlying medical condition 1 Lastly there were three pediatric deaths in this report but investigation is still necessary to confirm COVID 19 as the cause 1 14 3 Newborn and Infant Considerations 14 3 1 Mother to Child Vertical Transmission At this point COVID 19 has not been detected in cord blood amniotic fluid or placenta A study in China has shown maternal viremia levels to be only 1 7 With low levels of the virus in maternal blood placental seeding and vertical transmis sion are unlikely 8 In a review of 51 pregnant women with COVID 19 there were no cases of intrauterine transmission documented 8 However there have been reports of infants having positive nasopharyngeal cultures on days 1 or 2 of life as well as an increased immunoglobulin M IgM level 8 Nevertheless IgM studies are known to be a challenging and unreliable way to diagnose many congenital infections According to a study by Kimberlin et al IgM assays can be prone to false positive and false negative results along with cross reactivity and testing challenges 9 Moreover these early infant infections could have been due to postnatal contact with infected caregivers 8 In sum more definitive evidence is needed regarding COVID 19 and vertical transmission In terms of delivery outcomes of pregnant women with COVID 19 pneumonia a study of nine such livebirths provides some valuable information Reassuringly these 9 newborns all had 1 min Apgar scores of 8 9 and a 5 min Apgar score of 9 10 10 Also the amniotic fluid cord blood neonatal throat swab and breast milk samples from six of these patients were tested for the virus and all samples were negative 10 14 3 2 Breastfeeding The previously mentioned study also has implications for breastfeeding To reiter ate none of the six COVID positive mothers had the virus detected in their breast milk Nevertheless clearly droplet transmission could occur through the close con tact of breast or bottle feeding Therefore it is currently advised that mothers with confirmed or suspected infection take precautions to prevent transmission during 145 feeds hand hygiene and use of a facemask 11 The other option is to feed the infant expressed breast milk or formula by another healthy caregiver until the mother has recovered 11 If the mother chooses to pump breast milk she should wash her hands beforehand and wear a mask during breastfeeding Optimally the pumping equip ment should be thoroughly cleaned by a healthy person 11 14 4 Prevention It is well known that children play a key role in community based viral transmission and this may be further augmented in the case of COVID 19 because they have more mild disease that is likely to go undetected as well as more nasopharyngeal carriage and upper respiratory involvement Children also have more gastrointestinal symptoms from COVID 19 compared with adults 6 and there has even been evidence of fecal shedding in the stool for several weeks after diagnosis 12 From a public health stand point the potential fecal oral transmission of the virus and its replication in the GI tract is especially concerning for infants and children who are not toilet trained 13 In terms of disease prevention during this pandemic many pediatricians are being asked the same questions which we will address here Alcohol based hand sanitizer is safe for children when used according to the information on the Drug Facts label there is no cause for concern if children eat or lick their hands after the hand sanitizer has fully dried 14 However it should be kept out of reach of small children and those 6 years of age should be supervised when using the sanitizer 14 In terms of masks the CDC recommends cloth face coverings in public places but they are not recom mended for children 2 years of age because of concerns about suffocation 14 5 Diagnosis The requirements for COVID 19 testing in the pediatric ambulatory setting vary geographically but generally do not differ from the adult guidelines Therefore in the United States pediatric testing should follow the CDC s Priority 1 3 schema https www cdc gov coronavirus 2019 ncov hcp clinical criteria html Of note asymptomatic children regardless of high risk medical conditions or household contacts should not be tested There are many clinical pathways for screening of children during the pandemic but we will include the algorithms posted by the Children s Hospital of Philadelphia Ambulatory Setting https www chop edu clinical pathway 2019 novel coronavirus ambulatory clinical pathway Inpatient Setting https www chop edu clinical pathway recommendations sars cov 2 testing clinical pathway Children with fever and no other symptoms are not a high priority group for COVID testing according to the CDC However infants with isolated fever admitted 146 Chapter 14 Pediatric Manifestations of COVID 19 Management to rule out invasive bacterial infection IBI could also be tested for COVID 19 because young infants have been COVID positive with fever as their only manifesta tion 15 Testing this group would also stop potential spread of the virus in the hospital In regard to auxiliary testing laboratory findings are often normal in pediatric COVID positive patients but may include leukopenia lymphocytopenia and increased level of procalcitonin or C reactive protein CRP 16 In terms of imaging pediatric chest radiographs vary from unremarkable to bilateral consolidation 17 and imaging findings may even be present before symptom onset 18 14 6 Management 14 6 1 Outpatient If the child has suspected or confirmed COVID 19 infection has mild symptoms and does not have any of the aforementioned comorbidities he or she should be managed at home 16 The recommended at home supportive care is similar for any other viral respiratory illness with a heightened focus on prevention of transmission to others There should be close follow up with these patients Monitor for any signs of clinical deterioration which in infants could manifest itself as central cyanosis grunting or difficulty with breast bottle feeding Below are some useful links from the American Academy of Pediatrics AAP to provide to families during the pandemic Simple Ways to

without the need for new or increased non invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation 19 It has been described that this group tends to recover with supportive care alone which is generally considered the mainstay of treatment for COVID 19 in children 16 Chiotos et al define critical disease in a child with new or increased require ment for invasive or non invasive mechanical ventilation sepsis or multi organ failure or rapidly worsening clinical trajectory that does not yet meet these crite ria 19 This group generally has failed supportive therapy to some extent and there fore could benefit from antiviral medication 19 The Pediatric Infectious Disease Society has endorsed the Chiotos et al s report which has a final recommendation of the following A decision making framework for antiviral therapy that weighs risks and benefits based on disease severity as indicated by respiratory support needs with consideration on a case by case basis of potential pediatric risk factors for disease progression 19 If antiviral is indicated then remdesivir is the preferred agent 19 Hydroxychloroquine could also be considered if remdesivir is contraindi cated or unavailable 19 There are

f069517fbda6 14 7 Discussion From a pathophysiologic perspective why do children have lower frequency of infection and more mild disease from COVID 19 This very important clinical question can and should propel our research forward in order to help us to understand more about this virus and its infectivity Current theories include a less intense immune cytokine response from children toward the virus as opposed to adults 20 an interference in respiratory epithelium of young children that causes a lower viral load 16 or perhaps that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE2 receptor is expressed differently in the respiratory tract of children versus adults 21 From a public health standpoint we would like to address school and daycare openings These decisions are clearly very difficult but those responsible ought to be informed of the differences of this virus in children versus adults A 148 Chapter 14 Pediatric Manifestations of COVID 19 Update 1 Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Potentially Associated with COVID 19 decision based on general population data alone would discount the impact that children have as vectors for this virus and could potentially risk another rise of this pandemic Children have a more insidious nature of active disease because it is milder tends to have more upper respiratory and gastrointestinal involve ment and is less likely to present with fever and cough than in adults The risk of transmission in the community is compounded by children who are not toilet trained or have underdeveloped personal hygiene habits Therefore children are both more likely to be unknowingly sent out of the home while shedding the virus and more likely to spread it while away Of course decisions of this mag nitude must be weighed against the economic burden on families and nations Moreover it is self evident that schools are fundamental to child development and well being which also must be considered when planning the timing for school re entry Lastly we must qualify the data presented in this chapter by stating that all of the referenced studies and reports have their limitations given the newness and acuteness of this crisis Our knowledge of this virus is limited and evolving daily We hope this summary acts as a springboard for future research and investigation 14 8 Update 1 Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Potentially Associated with COVID 19 There is a rising concern in the pediatric community regarding a potential multi system inflammatory disease that is related to COVID 19 On April 27 2020 the Paediatric Intensive Care Society of the UK released a statement about a small rise in the number of cases of critically ill children presenting with an unusual clinical picture 22 This alert described pediatric patients presenting with clinical manifestations similar to toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters consistent with severe COVID 19 in children 22 These parameters appear to be high CRP high erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR and high ferritin 22 The report continued Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms have been a common feature as has cardiac inflammation 22 The latter may present as myocarditis with increased levels of troponin and pro BNP and may even have an appearance of their coronary arteries in keeping with Kawasaki disease 22 The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health later provided the following case definition for this multisystem inflammatory syndrome 23 1 A child presenting with persistent fever inflammation neutrophilia elevated CRP and lymphopenia and evidence of single or multiorgan dysfunction shock cardiac respiratory renal gastrointestinal or neurological disorder with additional features This may include children fulfilling full or partial criteria for Kawasaki disease 23 149 2 Exclusion of any other microbial cause including bacterial sepsis staphylo coccal or streptococcal shock syndromes infections associated with myocar ditis such as enterovirus waiting for results of these investigations should not delay seeking expert advice 23 3 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 polymerase chain reaction PCR testing may be positive or negative 23 On May 4 2020 the New York City Health Department released a similar state ment describing 15 pediatric cases aged 2 15 years compatible with this same disease in New York City hospitals According to this report All patients had sub jective or measured fever and more than half reported rash abdominal pain vomit ing or diarrhea Of note respiratory symptoms were reported in less than half of these patients In these cases PCR results for SARS CoV 2 also varied Therefore the International PICU COVID 19 Collaboration now refers to this emerging syn drome as Pediatric Multi System Inflammatory Syndrome Potentially Associated with COVID 19 24 and they have laid out some key takehome points 24 The disease is rare 24 Clinicians who suspect a case should consult promptly with pediatric infec tious disease rheumatology or critical care specialists 24 Because some children get sicker rapidly they should be cared for in hospi tals with tertiary pediatric cardiac intensive care units 24 Laboratory evaluation should include the measurement of sequential inflam matory markers including complete blood count differential CRP ESR coagulation parameters including D dimer and ferritin liver function mark ers and a cytokine panel Children should have antibody testing in addition to PCR testing for SARS CoV 2 since many children are antibody positive even when PCR negative 24 Children with this syndrome should have serial echocardiograms including a detailed assessment of the coronary arteries Many to date have been found to have low heart function and some have enlargement of the coronary arter ies Children with serious cardiac complications should be followed longer term 24 Why this is occurring is largely unexplained There is speculation that this syndrome is due to an acquired immune response to COVID 19 but it is still a mystery at this point In regard to an etiology cardiologist and international expert on Kawasaki disease Jane Newburger MD MPH states If you look at the curves COVID 19 has plateaued but there s an exponential rise in this sec ondary type of shock syndrome It is even possible that the antibodies that chil dren are making to SARS CoV2 are creating an immune reaction in the body Nobody knows 24 More research on this topic is both necessary and forthcoming For now it is important that health care providers be aware of the existence of this disease in children particularly during this time of pandemic 150 Chapter 14 Pediatric Manifestations of COVID 19 Update 2 July 1 2020 14 9 Update 2 July 1 2020 Here we will provide the key pediatric updates to this ever evolving pandemic cri sis We will list the updates in bullet point form and provide links to important websites and articles Last updated on 6 25 2020 the AAP has issued the following statement regarding guidance for school re entry the AAP strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of hav ing students physically present in school The importance of in person learning is well documented and there is already evidence of the negative impacts on children because of school closures in the spring of 2020 25 The full AAP docu ment outlines social distancing and mask use at schools testing and temperature checks at schools as well as bussing cafeteria mealtime and playground recom mendations The full statement can be found here https services aap org en pages 2019 novel coronavirus covid 19 infections clinical guidance covid 19 planning considerations return to in person education in schools Published June 8 2020 the investigation by Whittaker et al outlines the clinical characteristics of children with Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally Associated with SARS CoV 2 PIMS TS This was a case series of 58 children admitted to eight different hospitals in England Briefly the major results were as follows Of these children all had fever and non specific symptoms such as abdominal pain 31 53 rash 30 52 and conjunctival injection 26 45 29 50 developed shock and required inotropic support or fluid resuscitation 13 22 met diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki Disease and 8 14 had coronary artery dilatation or aneurysms 26 Thus the key takeaways here are that children with this disease have a wide range of signs symptoms and severity and that when you compare PIMS TS to Kawasaki disease and Kawasaki disease shock syndrome you find that this disorder is unique from other pediatric inflammatory entities For more information on how visit the full JAMA article here https jamanetwork com journals jama fullarticle 2767209 Published in JAMA on June 3 2020 the case series investigation by Wu et al

aggravated inflammatory responses often seen in adults with COVID 19 27 https pccsociety uk covid19 They also found that moderate dis ease had higher interleukin 10 IL 10 levels and lower neutrophil levels than patients with more mild disease They concluded The results of this study suggest that dysregulation of immune response may be involved in the patho logic process of COVID 19 gaining a deeper understanding of the role of neu trophils CD4 T cells and B cells in the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection could be important for the clini cal

decades of the 21st century have been marked by the emergence of three novel coronal viral illnesses with an unique set of systemic clinical and radio logical manifestations severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS and coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 In this chapter we briefly touch on the radiological findings of SARS and MERS and discuss the common radiological manifestations of COVID 19 15 2 Radiological Manifestations of SARS and MERS SARS and MERS are known to have an abnormal initial chest screening in at least 80 of infected patients In SARS early findings include ground glass opacifica tion or consolidations which are predominantly ill defined unilateral peripherally distributed with a propensity for the lower lung zones The abnormalities are focal 155 in 50 of cases multifocal in 40 and diffuse in 10 As SARS progresses the findings become progressively multifocal and spread bilaterally over the course of 2 weeks In one fourth of patients findings can remain focal or unilateral Computed tomographic scan CT findings typically demonstrate interstitial ground glass opacity early in the course of disease 2 In MERS initial radiographic findings include ground glass opacification or consolidations which are predominantly ill defined multifocal and within the lower lung zones The opacities may extend to perihilar and upper lobes as the dis ease continues As in SARS CT for MERS also typically demonstrates ground glass opacities in the basilar and peripheral lung zones interlobular septal thickening air space consolidation and rarely pleural effusions After recovery patients with disease can suffer from instances of fibrosis 1 2 3 Studies comparing SARS MERS and COVID 19 have found significant simi larities with some differences All three diseases upon initial presentation to hospi tals are found to have abnormal initial lung chest X ray findings in at least 69 85 of patients Common radiographic and CT findings include ill defined ground glass opacification or consolidation with a propensity of the disease to be peripheral and basilar Pneumothorax cavitation and pleural effusions are rare Similarities also include a disease progression toward multifocal airspace consolidation and acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS with worsening of pulmonary disease Notable differences between SARS MERS and COVID 19 include the greater likelihood of bilateral and multifocal lung involvement earlier with MERS and COVID 19 as compared with SARS Table 15 1 summarizes some clinical and ini tial hospital radiological presentations of these diseases 2 We will discuss the radio graphic and computed tomographic findings of COVID 19 in greater detail in subsequent sections 15 3 Radiological Findings of COVID 19 15 3 1 Chest X Rays CXR Chest radiographs may show no abnormality with mild or early infection with SARS CoV 2 With progression of pulmonary infection hazy interstitial opacities often with ground glass appearance develop These tend to be of bilateral periph eral and basilar predominance This distribution of this opacity is similar to that demonstrated on CT but is more difficult to detect requiring careful scrutinization Airspace consolidation may also develop and present as denser areas of opacity Worsening of lung disease may lead to an ARDS The presence of a significant pleural effusion is uncommon One study from Hong Kong evaluated the radiographs of 64 COVID 19 patients admitted to a hospital This study showed that baseline chest radiography was posi tive in 69 of patients as compared to 91 for initial reverse transcription 156 Chapter 15 Radiology of Chest Imaging in COVID 19 Radiological Findings of COVID 19 Table 15 1 Brief Summary of Clinical

or months polymerase chain reaction RT PCR test for COVID 19 and that chest radiographic abnormalities preceded a positive RT PCR test in only 9 of patients Additionally the study demonstrated that the worst interstitial opacity on CXR occurred 10 12 days after the onset of respiratory symptoms 4 Another study evaluated the initial chest radiographs of 636 COVID 19 patients at urgent care centers in New York City and New Jersey This study demonstrated that 42 of the initial chest radiographs on these patients were positive As may be expected patients presenting to urgent care centers are less sick than patients pre senting to hospitals and a higher percentage of chest radiographs may be normal in outpatient settings 5 Another study performed in New York City evaluated 338 young and middle aged adults between ages 21 and 50 years who presented to the emergency room with a positive test for COVID 19 on RT PCR The authors focused on correlating initial radiographic findings with hospitalization and intubation 6 They divided the lungs into 6 zones a lower zone middle zone and upper zone on each side Each lung zone was given a binary score with airspace opacity present equaling 1 and absence of airspace opacity equaling 0 The maximum score possible was therefore 6 They found that a chest radiograph severity score greater than or equal to 2 was 158 Chapter 15 Radiology of Chest Imaging in COVID 19 Radiological Findings of COVID 19 Figure 15 1 Middle aged female presented with nausea vomiting and cough and diagnosed by RT PCR with COVID 19 Top image shows an initial chest radiograph with mild bilateral ground glass airspace opacity Bottom image shows the follow up chest radiograph 3 days later There is now worse denser more consolidative airspace opacity within the bilateral lungs associated with hospital admission and that among these patients a chest radio graph severity score greater than or equal to 3 was an independent predictor of the patient becoming intubated Figure 15 1 6 15 3 2 Computed Tomography The Fleischner Society is an international multidisciplinary medical society for tho racic radiology and has made a glossary of terms for thoracic imaging According to their glossary the term ground glass opacity is an area of hazy increased lung opacity within which margins of pulmonary vessels may be indistinct 7 On CT it appears as hazy increased opacity of the lung with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins Ground glass opacity is less opaque than consolidation in which bronchovascular margins are obscured 159 On CT early COVID 19 pneumonia characteristically presents as interstitial ground glass opacity most often rounded with bilateral peripheral and basilar pre dominance A crazy paving pattern has also been described According to the Fleischner Society glossary a crazy paving pattern appears as thickened interlobu lar septa and intralobular lines superimposed on a background of ground glass opacity resembling irregularly shaped paving stones 7 Additionally a reversed halo sign may be present A reversed halo sign is a focal rounded area of ground glass opacity surrounded by a ring of consolidation 7 There may represent areas of micro vascular dilatation within areas of ground glass opacity 8 With progression of lung disease airspace consolidations may develop Finally in later stages ARDS may develop often leading to intubation Imaging findings not typical of COVID 19 pneumonia include isolated lobar or segmental consolidation numerous small nod ules pulmonary parenchymal cavitation a significant pleural effusion and promi nent mediastinal lymphadenopathy It is important to keep in mind that very early in the course of disease CT chest may be normal One retrospective study evaluated 121 symptomatic patients infected with SARS CoV 2 based on RT PCR from four centers in China during the months of January and February 2020 9 This study evaluated common CT findings in relation ship to the time between onset of patient symptoms typically fever and or cough and time of initial CT Early phase was defined as a CT performed within the first 2 days of onset of symptoms intermediate phase was defined as a CT performed between 3 and 5 days of onset of symptoms and late phase was defined as a CT performed between 6 and 12 days of onset of symptoms 56 of patients who were imaged with CT in the early phase had a normal chest CT With a longer time period between the onset of symptoms and the initial CT typical CT findings of COVID 19 pneumonia were more often present Bilateral lung disease was demonstrated in 28 of patients imaged during the early phase of disease 76 of patients imaged during the interme diate phase of disease and 88 of patients imaged during the late phase of disease On the other hand it is also known that CT findings may be present preceding symptom onset One study evaluated chest CT findings of 104 people who tested positive for COVID 19 with RT PCR who were on board the cruise ship Diamond Princess which had docked in Japan 10 73 76 104 of infected persons were asymptomatic and 54 41 76 of these people had opacities in the lungs on CT There was more ground glass opacity than consolidation in these people and milder extent of lung opacities compared with those who had symptomatic infection Salehi et al reported on the CT findings of COVID 19 pneumonia utilizing an extensive literature search of PubMed Embase Elsevier Google Scholar and World Health Organization databases 11 919 patients with COVID 19 were included in the final review The most common finding on initial CT was bilateral multilobar ground glass opacity which had a peripheral or posterior distribution and was most prevalent in the lower lobes Follow up CT demonstrated an increase in ground glass opacity lesions in both number and size and ground glass opacity progressively turn ing into consolidation septal thickening and crazy paving pattern with the worst disease on CT seen approximately 10 days after the onset of symptoms Disease either regressed or progressed to ARDS which was the most common reason for transfer of patients to the ICU and the major cause of death Imaging corresponding 160 Chapter 15 Radiology of Chest Imaging in COVID 19 Radiological Findings of COVID 19 to the improvement of patient symptoms most often occurred after 2 weeks of dis ease and included gradual improvement and resolution of consolidation and decreased number of pulmonary lesions and number of pulmonary lobes involved Another study evaluated the temporal changes of pneumonia as seen on CT in 90 patients with COVID 19 pneumonia who were admitted to the hospital 12 70 patients were discharged from the hospital at the end of the study with criteria being significant improvement in respiratory symptoms afebrile for at least 3 days imaging improve ment of disease and 2 consecutive negative RT PCR laboratory results at least 24 hours apart 94 66 70 of patients discharged had residual disease on CT with ground glass opacity 60 42 70 being the most common finding and pure ground glass opacity without consolidation 74 31 42 being the most common subtype Acute pulmonary embolism is not unusual in patients with COVID 19 pneumo nia One study demonstrated 23 of patients who had severe clinical COVID 19 pneumonia and had undergone CT pulmonary angiography had acute pulmonary embolism in addition to pneumonia Figures 15 2 15 7 13 Figure 15 2 Middle aged female presented with cough and diagnosed by RT PCR with COVID 19 Top image shows initial chest radiograph with bilateral mild interstitial opacities worst in the left upper lobe Bottom image shows same day CT with typical findings of COVID 19 pneumonia with bilateral peripheral ground glass airspace opacities and an area of denser consolidation in the left lower lobe 161 Figure 15 3 Elderly female presented with fever and diarrhea and diagnosed with COVID 19 by RT PCR Top image shows an initial chest radiograph with mild ground glass opacity in the left lung Bottom image shows same day CT chest with corresponding opacity in the lingula Figure 15 4 Same patient as in Figure 15 2 Chest radiograph taken 9 days later on day of death There are support lines and tubes There is very significantly worse denser more consolidative airspace opacity within the bilateral lungs 162 Chapter 15 Radiology of Chest Imaging in COVID 19 Radiological Findings of COVID 19 Figure 15 5 Elderly male with newly diagnosed heart failure and positive for COVID 19 by RT PCR Top image shows CT with filling defects within bilateral segmental pulmonary artery branches compatible with pulmonary emboli There are also bilateral pleural effusions due to congestive heart failure Bottom image shows the same CT lung windows with bilateral lower lobe airspace opacity In the left lower lobe a reversed halo lesion is beginning to form with a focal rounded area of ground glass opacity surrounded by a ring of denser consolidation Even though this finding is typical of COVID 19 pneumonia a pulmonary infarct due to pulmonary embolism can have the same appearance 163 Figure 15 6 Elderly male presented with fever myalgia cough and shortness of breath and positive for COVID 19 by RT PCR Top image shows an initial chest radiograph with minimal ground glass opacity in the retrocardiac left lower lobe Middle image shows the follow up chest radiograph performed 5 days later There is significantly worse diffuse ground glass opacity within the bilateral lungs Bottom image shows a follow up chest radiograph performed 10 days later on the day of discharge from hospital There is still ground glass opacity within the bilateral lungs but it is improved 164 Chapter 15 Radiology of Chest Imaging in COVID 19 Radiological Findings of COVID 19 Figure 15 7 Same patient as in Figure 15 5 CT chest performed at time of peak lung disease There is a crazy paving pattern of lung disease with thickened interlobular septa and intralobular lines superimposed on a background of ground glass opacity This finding is a commonly reported imaging feature of COVID 19 pneumonia 15 3 3 CT Reports Some organizations have put forth consensus statements to standardize reporting language or CT scoring systems regarding the possibility of COVID 19 pulmonary infection The Radiological Society of North America RSNA proposes dividing reporting language into four classifications for cases where COVID 19 pneumonia is a clinical possibility according to Table 15 2 Proposed reporting language for CT findings related to COVID 19 includes rationale CT findings and suggested reporting language for each category Suggested reporting language includes coding of CT findings for data mining Associated CT findings for each category are based upon available literature at the time of writing in March 2020 noting the retrospective nature of many reports including biases related to patient selection in cohort studies examination timing and other potential confounders 1 Inclusion in a report of items noted in parentheses in the Suggested Reporting Language column may depend upon clinical suspicion local prevalence patient status as a UI and local procedures regarding reporting 2 CT is not a substitute for RT PCR consider testing according to local recom mendations and procedures for and availability of RT PCR These classifications are categorized as typical appearance indeterminate appear ance atypical appearance and negative for pneumonia A typical appearance would be peripheral bilateral ground glass opacity with or without denser consolidation or crazy paving multiple rounded ground glass opacities or reverse halo sign lesions An indeterminate appearance would be diffuse perihilar or unilateral ground glass opacity which is not rounded in appearance and not peripheral in distribution An atypical appearance would be isolated lobar or segmental consolidation without 165 ground glass opacity numerous small discrete nodules cavitation or smooth inter lobular septal thickening and pleural effusion Negative for pneumonia would be no CT findings of pneumonia Keep in mind that other infectious or noninfectious dis eases can have the same appearance as a CT classification of typical appearance for COVID 19 pneumonia and a negative for pneumonia CT does not completely exclude the possibility of COVID 19 pulmonary infection This leads us to the next topic of the utility of CT chest for diagnosis of COVID 19 pneumonia Table 15 2 Reporting Language Proposed for CT Findings Related to COVID 19 Routine screening CT for diagnosis or exclusion of COVID 19 is currently not recommended by most professional organizations or the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID 19 Pneumonia Imaging Classification Typical appearance Indeterminate appearance Rationale CT Findings Commonly reported imaging features of greater specificity for COVID 19 pneumonia Peripheral bilateral GGO with or without consolidation or visible intralobular lines crazy paving Multifocal GGO of rounded morphology with or without consolidation or visible

North America GGO ground glass opacity aSuggested coding for future data mining 15 3 4 CT Screening Should CT be used for screening patients for COVID 19 pneumonia Most radiol ogy organizations do not recommend CT screening routinely to diagnose COVID 19 pneumonia The Fleischner Society came out with a multinational consensus statement addressing this question 15 In it they stated that imaging with CXR or CT is not indicated in patients suspected of having COVID 19 with mild symptoms unless they are at risk for worsening disease imaging is indicated in patients who have COVID 19 pneumonia and worsening respiratory status and in a resource constrained environment imaging is indicated to triage patients with moderate to severe clinical features who have a high pretest probability of COVID 19 pneumo nia In their statement the Fleischner Society did not specify in these recommenda tions whether the imaging modality to be used should be CXR or CT as this would 167 be based upon local resources and expertise Although CT is better for detecting early or mild pneumonia and alternative diagnoses it is significantly more expen sive more time consuming and involves a greater radiation dose 15 3 5 CT Protocol Chest CT volume reconstructions at 0 625 1 5 mm slice thickness ideally evaluate interstitial lung disease Intravenous contrast is not required except in cases where the vasculature needs to be evaluated such as CT pulmonary angiography for the evaluation of pulmonary embolism 15 4 Ultrasound Lung ultrasound has advantages in that it is low cost does not use ionizing radia tion and can be done portably at the bedside which is particularly helpful in the emergency department or intensive care unit setting Findings seen on lung ultra sound in COVID 19 pneumonia include B lines consolidative pattern thickened pleural lines and A lines during the recovery phase 16 17 The World Health Organization WHO recently published a guide on imaging in COVID 19 in which they stated that although lung ultrasound has very low certainty evidence supporting its diagnostic accuracy it might be helpful with the appropriate expertise as a supplemental or alternative imaging modality particu larly in pregnant women children and patients who are mechanically ventilated 18 15 5 Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI While CT utilizes X rays MRI uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce its images utilizing the signal obtained from the relaxation of protons within the body While CT is more available less expensive and is a much quicker examination to perform MRI can provide greater sensitivity for pathology in many cases depending on the organ and what disease is being evaluated for The strong magnetic fields used in MRI may preclude imaging of patients who have certain ferromagnetic medical devices such as pacemakers although more and more medical devices including some pacemakers are becoming MRI compatible The clinical utility of MRI for evaluating the lungs is limited Because the lungs are full of air and are therefore relatively proton deficient MRI has a limited sensi tivity for pulmonary pathology Air additionally results in bulk susceptibility arti facts on MRI limiting visualization of anatomy in and around structures that contain air One of the clinical roles for MRI in evaluating the chest is evaluating for cardiac myocarditis 168 Chapter 15 Radiology of Chest Imaging in COVID 19 References The Journal of the American College of Cardiology JACC scientific expert panel has updated consensus recommendations for cardiovascular magnetic reso nance CMR diagnosis of myocardial inflammation in patients suspected of having acute or active myocardial inflammation in 2018 19 These updated criteria referred to as the updated Lake Louise Criteria II are evaluating for myocardial edema and inflammation and require abnormality on both T2 based and T1 based magnetic resonance imaging with supportive criteria including the presence of a pericardial effusion or signs of pericarditis and cardiac left ventricular systolic wall motion abnormality The administration of MRI gadolinium based intravenous contrast during the examination to evaluate for late enhancement of the myocardium in a nonischemic pattern is helpful to make the diagnosis but is not absolutely necessary One study from Germany evaluated the presence of myocardial injury on CMR in 100 patients recently recovered from COVID 19 infection 20 This study showed that there was cardiac involvement in 78 of patients with ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60 of patients independent of preexisting conditions severity and length of acute illness time from original diagnosis or the presence of cardiac symptoms References 1 Radiology lessons for coronavirus from

will be discussed in this chapter The main focus of this chapter is on the management of hypoxemic respiratory failure in the intubated and nonintubated patient Special considerations in management including the role of anticoagula tion and corticosteroids in COVID 19 patients will also be discussed 171 16 2 Epidemiology In 20 of cases COVID 19 can become severe very quickly and some patients rapidly deteriorate 1 week after the start of symptoms Severe COVID 19 is charac terized by worsening dyspnea hypoxia or greater than 50 lung involvement on imaging within 24 48 h of presenting symptoms Wu et al reported that 14 of COVID 19 patients have severe disease hypox emia or greater than 50 lung involvement on imaging and approximately 5 have critical disease respiratory failure multiorgan failure and or shock 1 Among those with critical disease case fatality rate was reported to be 49 Among patients who develop severe disease the mean duration to develop dyspnea was 5 8 days acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS was 8 12 days and intensive care unit ICU admission was 10 12 days 2 3 Hypoxemic respiratory failure is the most common reason patients with COVID 19 are admitted to the ICU 4 Mortality among patients admitted to the ICU has been reported to be between 39 and 72 Of critically ill patients 71 need mechanical ventilation often requiring extended mechanical ventilation with a median time to extubation of 11 17 days 5 About 70 eventually require vasopressors and 33 will develop cardiomyopathy 6 Increased age comorbidities diabetes hyperten sion coronary artery disease malignancy and chronic lung disease and laboratory abnormalities have been associated with disease severity In addition to provider concern high nursing requirements and risk of decom pensation from severe comorbid illness consideration for transfer or admission to the ICU includes signs of respiratory distress rapid increase in oxygen require ment high work of breathing oxygen need greater than 6 liters per minute LPM hemodynamic instability acidosis pH 7 3 and high levels of lactate 2 If the decision is made to transfer to the ICU hospital policy for transfer and personal protective equipment PPE must be followed to minimize the risk of transmission to health care workers 16 3 Initial Testing and Imaging For most ICU patients the COVID 19 nasal swab and comprehensive respiratory panel testing would have already been collected in the emergency department If not this will need to be done once admitted to the ICU Additional laboratory test ing that will need to be drawn on patients with severe COVID 19 includes chemistry panel and liver function tests LFTs including albumin complete blood count CBC with differential procalcitonin ferritin triglycerides fibrinogen C reactive protein CRP erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR troponin lactate dehydroge nase LDH creatine phosphokinase CPK D dimer and prothrombin time PT 7 Most of these laboratories are regularly repeated throughout the patient s ICU stay because they have been found to be markers that may track the disease severity and prognosis Table 16 1 Troponin as well as an electrocardiogram ECG or EKG is used to assess for cardiomyopathy and conduction disturbances in a deteriorating 172 Chapter 16 Severe COVID 19 and ICU Initial Testing and Imaging Table 16 1

imaging portable chest X rays CXRs are sufficient in most cases for assessing the patient s lung parenchyma 10 The most common CXR finding is bilat eral patchy infiltrates which may evolve rapidly 11 Routine chest CT increases the risk of viral transmission to health care workers and has a low specificity as a screen ing tool 12 13 It is generally not recommended by the American College of Radiology 14 On CT scan COVID 19 pneumonia was similar to a viral pneumonia but was more likely to have ground glass opacifications vascular thickening and fine reticular opacities 15 However early in the course of the disease a normal chest CT does not exclude COVID 19 and an abnormal CT scan cannot diagnose COVID 19 Therefore CT scanning is limited to patients who clinically show symptoms of a complication such as an empyema or abscess or concern of pulmonary embolism Additionally bronchoscopy is not recommended or necessary for the purpose of ruling COVID 19 in or out and should be avoided to minimize aerosolization and increasing transmission Bronchoscopy should only be done if it will change clini cal management and should be completed in a negative pressure room if at all possible 173 Table 16 2 The Berlin Criteria for ARDS Berlin Criteria for ARDS16 Acute onset of 1 week or less Bilateral opacities on chest CT or CXR Must not be fully explained by cardiac failure or failure overload Oxygenation Mild Moderate Severe PaO2 FiO2 200 mmHg but 300 mmHg PEEP or CPAP 5 cm H2O PaO2 FiO2 100 mmHg but 200 mmHg PEEP 5 cm H2O PaO2 FiO2 100 mmHg PEEP 5 cm H2O 16 4 Etiology of Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure in COVID 19 In the media there has been discussion about whether hypoxemic respiratory failure from COVID 19 is ARDS another process similar to high altitude pulmonary edema HAPE or some other novel syndrome Since ARDS is not a specific dis ease but rather a clinical syndrome with varying disease severity COVID 19 fits the spectrum of ARDS as defined by the Berlin criteria Table 16 2 7 The noncardiogenic pulmonary edema edema that develops in the setting of normal left atrial pressures resulting from HAPE ARDS from COVID 19 and many other causes is due to an imbalance in Starling forces The reasons for the imbalance are markedly different between ARDS and HAPE In ARDS from COVID 19 or other causes inflammation and the innate immune response leads to damage of the alveolar epithelium and endothelium and increased capillary perme ability leading to fluid accumulation in both alveolar spaces and interstitium Proinflammatory cytokines secreted by alveolar macrophages sustain inflamma tion and lung injury leading to ventilation perfusion mismatch and hypoxemia On the other hand the noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that results from HAPE is due to excessive hypoxemic pulmonary vasoconstriction and not an inflammatory pro cess Therefore treating COVID 19 with medications used to manage HAPE is unlikely to be beneficial and may be harmful 16 5 Management of Hypoxemia in Nonintubated Patients Case series from Seattle China and Italy suggest a range of disease severity gas exchange impairments and respiratory compliance 2 3 17 18 For the management of hypoxemia in nonintubated individuals nasal cannula up to 6 LPM should be the first line treatment to meet oxygenation goals eg oxygen saturation 90 96 If not sufficient a nasal pendant can be used up to 12 L or a non rebreather up to 15 L should be used to titrate SpO2 saturation to greater than 90 174 Chapter 16 Severe COVID 19 and ICU Management of Intubated Patients Self proning spending as much time as is feasible and safe in the prone position while receiving oxygen may improve the recruitment of alveoli in dependent areas of the lung and may improve perfusion to ventilated areas thus improving V Q mismatching in nonintubated patients 19 Proning is used in ventilated patients and while low tidal volumes cannot be guaranteed in spontaneously breathing patients self proning in nonintubated patients is likely safe and is being used at some institu tions 20 21 There are conflicting opinions about using noninvasive ventilation and high flow nasal cannulas HFNCs to extend the time before a patient becomes intubated In patients who are suffering from ARDS studies show a frequent need for mechanical ventilation despite the use of these measures Another significant consideration is that both interventions aerosolize the virus risking infecting the staff and further increasing transmission Both the WHO and SCCM guidelines make weak recom mendations for HFNC in select patients 22 16 6 Management of Intubated Patients Early controlled elective intubation is recommended if there is 1 a rapid pro gression over hours 2 persistent or worsening hypoxemia despite nasal pen dant or non rebreather 3 hypercapnia accessory muscle use and altered mental status and or 4 hemodynamic stability or multiorgan failure Since intubation is a high risk procedure for droplet dispersion airborne PPE should be used and the procedures should be performed in an airborne infection isola tion room if possible Since COVID 19 associated respiratory failure fits the spectrum of ARDS evi dence based management of ARDS should be applied to COVID 19 associated respiratory failure The principles of ARDS management include lung protective ventilation low tidal volume ventilation LTVV 23 positive end expiratory pressure PEEP titration conservative fluid management and prone ventilation 16 6 1 Lung Protective Ventilation The initial ventilator settings should use the volume assisted control to achieve LTVV 4 8 cc kg of predicted body weight PBW targeting a plateau pressure Pplat 30 cm H2O LTTV adjusted by PBW and thereby lung size can minimize volutrauma overdistension of already open alveoli This approach is based on several RCTs showing an improved mortality from LTVV in patients with ARDS 24 16 6 2 PEEP Titration Titrating PEEP can prevent decruitment thereby increasing functional lung size and decreasing the risk of volutrauma PEEP and FiO2 are titrated to target oxygenation goal SpO2 92 96 per the ARDS net low PEEP Table 16 3 7 Patients are 175 Table 16 3 PEEP and FiO2 Levels and ARDS Low PEEP ARDS Net Table FIO2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 1 PEEP 5 5 8 10 10 14 14 14 18 18 24 sometimes started on higher than usual levels of PEEP 10 15 cm H2O since reports suggest that some COVID 19 ARDS patients are responsive to high PEEP and have high lung compliance such that Pplat 30 cm H2O is not difficult to achieve 16 6 3 Conservative Fluid Management A conservative fluid approach is one of the mainstays of ARDS management 25 ARDS is a form of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema due to increased capillary permeability 26 which can be worsened by an increase in hydrostatic forces The Fluid and Catheter Treatment trial showed that conservative fluid management can improve oxygenation ventilation free days and lung injury 27 Reducing intravascu lar volume to reduce pulmonary edema needs to be balanced with the need for adequate perfusion to nonpulmonary organs In practical terms this translated to avoiding a positive fluid balance sometimes requiring the administration of diuret ics in patients post resuscitation and without ongoing shock 16 6 4 Prone Ventilation Prone ventilation is the delivery of mechanical ventilation with the patient in the prone position and is a key component of management of patients with severe ARDS who are intubated Studies have demonstrated improved oxygenation and one study showed a mortality benefit with ventilation in the prone position in those with severe ARDS 28 30 Prone positioning is recommended for patients with severe ARDS whose P F remains less than 150 mmHg for 12 h despite ventilator optimiza tion with LTVV in the supine position Prone positioning is usually implemented early in the course of ARDS within 36 h and patients are usually maintained in the prone position for 16 18 consecutive hours per 24 h For patients who have a 176 Chapter 16 Severe COVID 19 and ICU Management of Intubated Patients sustained improvement in gas exchange prone positioning is usually stopped when improvement in oxygenation P F 150 mmHg FiO2 0 6 PEEP 10 cm H2O Ppl 30 pH 7 25 is maintained for at least 4 h after the end of the last prone session If prone ventilation fails the patient should be returned to the supine position Absolute contraindications to prone positioning include spinal instability or at risk for spinal instability unstable fractures shock anterior burns and open wounds recent tracheal surgery pregnancy and raised intracranial pressure Other contraindi cations include abdominal surgery hemodynamic instability and life sustaining car diac hardware Common complications include transient desaturations facial and ocular edema decubitus ulcers and dislodgement of catheters and endotracheal tubes 16 6 5 Inhaled Pulmonary Vasodilators Inhaled nitric oxide iNO a rapid acting vasodilator selectively vasodilates the already well ventilated areas improving V Q mismatch 31 A systematic review showed an improvement in P F ratios at 24 h but not at 48 or 72 h with iNO There were no differences in duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay but a significant increase in renal failure in the iNO group 32 There has been one small study in Beijing during the SARS epidemic showing that iNO improved oxy genation and decreased the amount of days on the ventilator 33 iNO may also have direct antiviral effects 34 36 iNO or other pulmonary vasodilators like nebulized epo prostenol a synthetic analogue of prostacyclin may therefore have a role as rescue therapy in some patients with COVID 19 who have persistent hypoxemia that is unresponsive to PEEP titration and prone ventilation 16 6 6 Veno Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation VV ECMO VV ECMO is a type of pulmonary bypass allowing oxygenation to occur via an external membrane Studies suggest that in severe ARDS ECMO could be used after the failure of optimized ARDS management Specifically ECMO can be con sidered when there are no reversible causes and P F is persistently 75 mmHG despite optimized PEEP neuromuscular blockade proning and inhaled vasodilator PPl 30 cm H2O despite lung protective ventilation and pH 7 2 Some studies suggest that referral to ECMO centers should be made early within 7 days of severe ARDS 37 Absolute and relative contraindications to ECMO include advanced age active malignancy severe shock multiorgan failure severe neurologic injury poor functional status inability to anticoagulate high body mass index 40 thrombo cytopenia platelets less than 50 and neutropenia absolute neutrophil count ANC 500 In the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization algorithm there are no absolute contraindications except for end stage respiratory failure when lung trans plantation is not an option Thromboembolism and bleeding are the major compli cations from ECMO 177 16 7 Sedation Analgesics Paralytics Prior studies show that lower levels of sedation and nonbenzodiazepine regimens decrease ICU days and duration of mechanical ventilation 38 To achieve appropri ate sedation and analgesia the lowest dose of any medication should be used to achieve the desired effect Ventilation synchrony is very important to help reduce ventilator induced lung injury and this is achieved by appropriately balancing the sedative analgesic and neuromuscular blockade agents 7 The Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale a validated 10 point scale 5 to 4 to assess a patient s level of sedation in the ICU can be used to help describe the level of alertness or agitation in mechanically ventilated patients to prevent over or under sedation 39 The target score is 0 to 1 to maintain synchrony without agitation 2 4 or over sedation 3 to 5 The preferred therapy for sedation in many centers is propofol so as to avoid the use of benzodiazepines particularly for patients with ARDS who have renal and or liver dysfunction Several cases of propofol associated triglycerides and pancreati tis have been reported 40 Although reported in less than 1 of patients propofol infusion syndrome should be considered in patients receiving either high dose 5 mg kg h or longer duration 48 h who have unexplained metabolic acidosis rhabdomyolysis and EKG changes with or without acute kidney injury cardiac failure or higher levels of liver enzymes lactate lipids or potassium Midazolam is often the second line therapy for sedation 41 Obese patients are at an increased risk for prolonged sedation given the accumulation of drug and metabolite in excess adipose tissue A slow and steady decrease in the rate of infusion can facilitate weaning without precipitating a withdrawal syndrome Since dexmedetomidine is unlikely to provide deep levels of sedation in the current climate it is often used as an adjunct to other sedatives or as a 24 to 48 h bridge to wean benzodiazepines to facilitate extubation For analgesia in intubated patients the first line therapy is fentanyl or hydromor phone because these agents are fast acting and titratable 7 Fentanyl is typically given as a continuous infusion Since fentanyl is highly lipophilic accumulation in fat and other tissues can result in prolonged sedation even after discontinuation Hydromorphone is an alternative to fentanyl with dosing adjusted for hepatic or renal insufficiency 7 Because of its longer duration of action hydromorphone is pre ferred if patients only require intermittent bolus dosing A subset of patients with severe ARDS PaO2 FiO2 150 after at least 12 h of mechanical ventilation using FiO2 0 6 and PEEP 5 cm H2O and ventila tor dys synchrony causing high plateau pressures 30cm H2O or injurious tidal volumes TV 8 cc kg IBW or hypoxemia may benefit from neuromuscu lar blockade Since neuromuscular blockade therapies do not have any analgesic or sedative properties deep sedation is necessary before neuromuscular block ade is initiated Cisatracurium is often used as a first line treatment and pre ferred in patients who have renal and liver dysfunction as well as hemodynamically unstable patients Alternative agents include vecuronium rocuronium and atracurium 7 178 Chapter 16 Severe COVID 19 and ICU Tracheostomy 16 8 Weaning and Extubation There is extensive literature on liberation from mechanical ventilation 42 Guidelines for consideration of a weaning trial include 1 ability to initiate own breaths 2 reso lution of the underlying disease process 3 improved gas exchange eg O2 satura tion 90 on 40 oxygen or less or PaO2 FiO2 150 4 minute ventilation requirements not excessive eg less than 12 L minute RR 30 5 preserved mental status 6 lack of excessive pulmonary secretions and 7 hemodynamic stability Once these criteria have been met daily spontaneous breathing trials SBT remain the most effective method to wean from mechanical ventilation 43 45 An SBT consists of a trial on minimal PEEP 5 cm H2O and pressure support usually 0 5 cm H2O for a set period of time 30 120 min The patient should be assessed for the following respiratory parameters SpO2 90 and or PaO2 60 mmHg sponta neous tidal volume 4 6 ml kg PBW respiratory rate less than 35 per min pH 7 3 and no signs of respiratory distress Once the patient can tolerate the SBT for 30 120 min while remaining hemodynamically stable with noncopious secretions and sufficient mental status extubation can be considered 46 Prior to extubation glucocorticoids should be considered due to evidence of pre venting stridor laryngeal edema and reducing the incidence of reintubation 47 49 Therefore 40 mg of methylprednisolone IV should be given 4 6 h prior to planned extubation with a maximum dose of 80 mg if extubation is delayed Patients who have passed an SBT and are considered at high risk for postextubation respiratory failure age 65 CHF COPD hypercapnia during SBT had improved outcomes with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation NIPPV or HFNC in the immediate postextubation period 50 52 Alternatively for patients who develop respiratory failure within 48 h of extubation NIPPV as a rescue therapy for respiratory failure has been shown in some studies to increase all cause mortality 53 Since intubation reintubation NIPPV and HFNC are considered aerosol gener ating procedures the following modifications should be considered in COVID19 patients Consider extending SBT trials to 2 h to ensure higher likelihood of postextu bation failure Consider an SBT trial with no additional PEEP to ensure patients can tolerate no PEEP postextubation Carefully consider the risk to health care workers and review hospital policy prior to using NIPPV and HFNC postextubation in COVID 19 patients that have passed an SBT trial but are at high risk for postextubation failure 16 9 Tracheostomy Since tracheostomy is an aerosol generating procedure and increases potential viral exposure to the health care team decision making in tracheostomy should take into account the surgical team and hospital policy The American Academy of 179 Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery has issued guidelines on tracheostomy during the COVID 19 pandemic 16 9 1 Tracheotomy Recommendations during the COVID 19 Pandemic At the time of this writing there is no data on the role of tracheostomy in COVID 19 patients Tracheostomy can be considered in patients with stable respiratory sta tus but not sooner than 2 3 from intubation Overall early tracheostomy placement earlier than 10 days is not recommended due to previous studies showing no improvement in survival ventilator associated pneumonia rate or duration of mechanical ventilation for patients with respiratory failure 54 It is important to note that the average duration of ventilation in COVID 19 patients is about 8 days and the average ICU stay is around 10 days Therefore there is minimal evidence to support early tracheostomy placements in COVID 19 patients even if early trache ostomies were to reduce health care resources Patients who have a tracheostomy placed need long term care and this needs to also be considered when thinking of placing early tracheostomies in patients who might be able to be extubated prior to needing a tracheostomy 55 16 10 Cytokine Storm It has been postulated that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID 19 exhibit a dysregulated immune response or cytokine storm that leads to progressive dis ease 56 The cytokine storm appears to be similar to the hyperinflammation seen in other virally triggered secondary HLH In HLH aggressive immune activation of macrophages leads to an excessive cytokine response with both laboratory and clin ical evidence of severe inflammation 57 This immune activation increases ferritin ESR and CRP decreases platelets and can lead to worsening respiratory failure and multiorgan failure It is unclear if immunosuppression in this subset of patients with severe inflam mation can improve mortality IL 6 activates T cells and macrophages and increased levels of IL 6 may be associated with COVID 19 disease severity 58 59 but it is unclear if blocking this cytokine could lead to improved clinical outcomes IL 1 is a proinflammatory cytokine elevated in critical illness Modulation of cytokines with monoclonal antibodies such as tocilizumab and sarilumab monoclonal anti bodies against the IL 6 receptor and anakinra recombinant antagonist of the IL 1 receptor is being studied in clinical trials Trials are additionally underway to test whether treatment with etoposide by eliminating the cells that are causing the excessive cytokine response improves clinical outcomes 7 The Hscore may be use ful in identifying patients with HLH who should be considered for clinical trials 60 This score calculates the probability of HLH by assessing characteristics such as underlying immunosuppression temperature hepatomegaly or splenomegaly 180 Chapter 16 Severe COVID 19 and ICU Anticoagulation in COVID 19 Patients number of cytopenias ferritin levels triglyceride and fibrinogen levels AST as well as if there are hemophagocytosis features on bone marrow aspirate 61 16 11 Shock Management While patients rarely present with shock MAP 65 or SBP 90 with signs of hypo perfusion requiring IVF or vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure vaso pressors are eventually used in about 70 of critically ill patients The reason for shock in patients with COVID 19 is most often secondary to bacterial infection cardiac dysfunction or cytokine storm 7 The workup for shock should include assessing for end organ damage altered mental status decreased urine output abnormal electrolytes and high levels of lactate LFTs and BUN creatinine and obtaining an infectious and cardiac workup One study reported that 20 of COVID 19 nonsurvivors had a secondary bacterial infection and that 52 of non survivors had heart failure or cardiogenic shock usually presenting later in the dis ease course 62 Management of septic shock should include early antibiotics and maintaining MAP above 65 mmHg Since the majority of ICU patients with COVID 19 have ARDS a more conservative fluid strategy is preferred over the conventional fluid strategy of 30 cc kg to avoid exacerbating ARDS Therefore 250 500 cc of fluid should be given and the patient assessed for an increase in MAP or decrease in pres sor requirements in 15 30 min 250 500 cc of fluid can be repeated If pressors are needed norepinephrine is the initial vasopressor of choice 1 30 mcg min 7 If a second vasopressor is needed vasopressin of 0 4 units can be used Cardiogenic shock should be comanaged with the cardiology team Routine monitoring should include troponin lactate LFTs SCvO2 or MvO2 and daily EKGs Achieving a mean arterial pressure MAP of greater than 65 may require a combination of vaso pressors norepinephrine diuretics and inotropic support dobutamine 16 12 Anticoagulation in COVID 19 Patients D dimer a marker associated with thrombosis is often increased in patients with severe COVID 19 and several studies have shown high rates of thrombotic events in patients with severe COVID 19 63 66 In addition ARDS of itself is known to be associated with coagulopathy and both macrovascular and microvascular thrombo sis Yet no clinical trials have demonstrated a benefit from therapeutic anticoagula tion in patients with ARDS 67 Although ARDS and COVID 19 are associated with hypercoagulable states there is a limited evidence that therapeutic anticoagulation improves outcomes Since critically ill patients with COVID 19 have a high rate of thrombosis 23 43 in ICU patients prophylactic anticoagulation is imperative for critically ill patients unless contraindicated Low molecular weight heparin is preferred but unfractionated heparin is used if kidney function is impaired creatinine clearance 181 30 ml min Some institutions use more aggressive anticoagulation with interme diate dose anticoagulation for prophylaxis in patients with very high D dimer lev els Therapeutic dose anticoagulation is used to treat deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism unless contraindicated 16 13 Corticosteroids in COVID 19 Patients Preliminary data from the RECOVERY trial a randomized trial of 6000 hospital ized patients with COVID 19 demonstrates that dexamethasone has a mortality benefit in patients with COVID 19 who require oxygen or are mechanically venti lated 68 Patients who did not require oxygen did not benefit from dexamethasone Therefore for patients with COVID 19 on supplemental oxygen whether sponta neously breathing or mechanically ventilated dexamethasone 6 mg either intrave nously or by mouth for 10 days the equivalent of 40 mg prednisone daily should strongly be considered if not contraindicated 16 14 Palliative Care In the ICU setting palliative care consult services have an increasingly important role in helping medical teams with goals of care and advanced care planning discussions with patients and health care proxies For patients who are end of life palliative care services also provide support and guidance in symptom management particularly with opioids and benzodiazepines to help control pain and anxiety Some hospitals like the Brigham and Women s Hospital implemented COVID 19 Intensive Palliative Care Units during the pandemic to help provide support and comfort focused care to COVID 19 patients with organ failure and an estimated prognosis of less than 1 week 7 Consultations with palliative care should happen early so that a plan is set in place that is in accordance with patients wishes These discussions are particularly important since cardiopulmonary resuscitation may not offer a benefit in some patients with COVID 19 particularly those with advanced age 80 years old and or comorbid cardiovascular disease hypertension diabetes and respiratory disease and increase transmission to health care workers Several resources are available to help providers initiate and respond to often very difficult conversations Center to advance palliative care

East respiratory syndrome Peripheral nervous system Severe acute respiratory syndrome Total lung capacity 17 1 Introduction Coronavirus disease COVID 19 is a new disease with the first positive cases emerging in December 2019 there are no studies about its long term impact on health especially in people with severe symptoms The evidence from earlier chap ters suggests that SARS CoV 2 can attach to and penetrate human cells in many parts of the body including many major organs such as the lungs heart kidneys brains and even blood vessels Although it may be too early to know of longer term complications of COVID 19 this chapter will discuss what has been learned about the pathophysiologies and long term complications seen in the cases of the other two coronaviruses Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS and severe acute respira tory syndrome SARS and compare potential similarities with COVID 19 1 17 2 SARS Post Recovery and Long Term Complications The literature assessing long term complications of SARS is now available given the long follow up time 18 years and allows for more complete analysis and under standing of the aftermath associated with this first 2003 coronavirus epidemic 187 In order to better discuss the health results from SARS post recovery will be defined as symptomology and complications associated with SARS within a 1 year span of disease recovery Long term complications will be defined as any disease symptomology or complications that persist or emerge 1 year following recovery In regard to the post recovery phase of SARS respiratory complications were seen to persist in people over 60 years who experienced severe symptoms 2 In 15 out of the 24 patients 62 who underwent computerized tomography CT of the thorax 5 weeks post hospitalization showed changes associated with pulmonary fibrosis in 62 of patients but a mild decrease in total lung capacity TLC 81 of predicted and forced vital capacity FVC In these patients the residual volume was at 65 of predicted In the post recovery phase 6 20 of SARS patients were found to have a mild to moderate muscle weakness 2 Another data series in the same study evaluated the health impact that SARS had on 258 patients from Xiaotangshan Hospital in Beijing It was reported that 2 months post hospitalization 21 54 individuals had impaired carbon monoxide diffusion while 6 16 had a restrictive ventilatory defect FVC 2 After an addi tional month the carbon monoxide diffusion capacity DLCO improved in 80 3 of those 54 patients and 81 3 of those 16 patients had an improved FVC The authors concluded that while most patients affected by SARS made a complete recovery after 3 months post discharge there were a small percentage of people that continued to have persisting respiratory problems The long lasting effects of SARS in some patients were confirmed by another study from Hong Kong that evaluated SARS patients at 6 months and 1 year after infection 3 At 6 months the researchers found that 33 30 of patients presented with abnormal chest radiographs and 4 7 and 16 of patients had FVC TLC and DLCO below 80 predicted respectively At 1 year follow up 27 28 had abnormal chest radiographs 4 5 and 23 of patients had FVC TLC and DLCO below 80 predicted respectively The study shows that while active recovery takes place within the first couple months post hospitalization the overall number of indi viduals who make a complete recovery from the SARS infection tapers off with a small subset of patients continuing to experience respiratory difficulties SARS studies of longer term lung function at 12 and 15 years post infection further reveal that while most patients did make a full recovery a small subset con tinued to experience permanent lung related damage 4 5 It is important to note that all subjects were normal on the basis of a clinical evaluation at the 12 year mark and only a more in depth examination revealed persistent lung injury Outside of respiratory concerns additional long term complications included muscle weakness chronic fatigue depression nonrestorative sleep and bone prob lems prominently among patients A study of 22 SARS patients in Toronto who were followed for 3 years mean 19 8 months found that the group had symptoms similar to fibromyalgia depression and sleep disturbance 6 In a study of 369 SARS survivors 40 3 experienced chronic fatigue syndrome 3 5 years after being diag nosed 7 Viral infections like Epstein Barr have been linked to chronic fatigue 188 Chapter 17 Post Recovery and Long Term Complications MERS Post Recovery and Long Term Complications Avascular necrosis of the hip was commonly reported as a side effect due to the high dose steroid treatment 2 A 15 year follow up study demonstrated that in the first year 21 17 of patients had some form of avascular necrosis on the femoral head of the hip joint Over time the clinical stage of femoral head necrosis actually progressed in some of these patients from 2003 to 2007 After 2007 the clinical stage of the femoral head necrosis stabilized in all patients 5 The last two common complications that were associated with post hospitaliza tion due to SARS were a reduced health related quality of life HRQoL and poor mental health At the 1 year follow up time the HRQoL was continually lower in the SARS survivor group compared to that of the normal control group assessed by utilizing a standardized 6 minute walk and a 36 item Short Form General Health Survey 3 In regard to SARS associated poor mental health a study reporting on a 5 week follow up of 101 patients found that 25 experienced anxiety and 14 reported symptoms of depression 2 In the same study 5 of patients reported expe riencing severe anxiety or depression 2 months after discharge Finally in a 15 year follow up period 42 5 77 of patients experienced at least one active psychiatric illness 5 While many of these individuals with poor mental health do eventually recover it is alarming that so many experienced poor mental health is a result of SARS infection 17 3 MERS Post Recovery and Long Term Complications Ten years after the SARS epidemic in Asia another deadly coronavirus appeared in the Middle East 8 MERS emerged in Saudi Arabia and was largely contained to the Arabian Peninsula but in 2015 there was an outbreak in South Korea 9 Mortality analysis of MERS CoV revealed a 29 8 overall mortality rate but a 45 2 mor tality rate for those above the age of 60 10 Similar to SARS respiratory illness was the largest complication in MERS In a study that looked at 73 patients who had MERS 25 18 of patients did not have pneumonia while the remaining 75 of patients experienced varying severi ties of pneumonia 11 After adjusting for multiple variables the study found that DLCO and FVC were significantly reduced among patients who presented with pneumonia 1 year after and that it was a dose dependent relationship those with more severe pneumonia having lower DLCO and FVC values 11 12 A substantial number of patients recovering from MERS develop lung fibrosis on imaging stud ies 9 As in the case of SARS reduced lung function and pulmonary fibrosis were the primary results in patients who recovered from MERS Aside from respiratory complications the MERS CoV infection also resulted in neurological complications and chronic fatigue syndrome In a case report pub lished by Algahani Subahi and Shirah the authors present two cases of individuals developing a neurological complication as a result of acquiring MERS In one case the patient developed an intracerebral hemorrhage due to platelet dysfunction 189 disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombocytopenia 12 In the second case the patient developed critical illness polyneuropathy In regard to the develop ment of chronic fatigue syndrome around 54 of patients who have survived the MERS CoV infection ended up developing the syndrome within a 2 year time span after being discharged from the hospital 12 The final major complication should be discussed in the reduction of quality of life in survivors of the MERS CoV virus Among those with different disease sever ities patients with greater disease severity had a significant p 0 05 reduction in the quality of life compared to those who experienced a lesser disease severity 13 Overall the SARS CoV and MERS CoV caused a plethora of different compli cations that provide a framework to better understand what pathologies to expect from SARS CoV 2 Respiratory neurological chronic fatigue syndrome reduced quality of life bone related issues muscle weakness and poor mental health are complications that needed to be considered for COVID 19 17 4 Post Recovery Phase of COVID 19 The first wave of COVID 19 pandemic is sweeping across the world and much of the initial research was focused solely on understanding its health related impacts including respiratory issues coagulopathy and cardiovascular associated problems and pediatric inflammatory syndrome found to be associated with the virus 14 16 As the pandemic evolves with some countries managing to control and reduce trans mission and others struggling to bring it under control there is more research dis cussing post recovery complications of COVID 19 and eventually long term complications associated with it As more information becomes available this sec tion will adapt and expand The first and most pressing question that arises after recovering from COVID 19 is whether an individual develops a robust immune response to the virus that prevents reinfection The recent literature indicates that detectable levels of IgM and IgG antibodies develop and can be tested for a few days after most individuals are infected with SARS CoV 2 17 but it is not definitive whether these are protective There have been cases in which patients who are discharged return a few days later with positive viral RT PCR levels even after having been undetectable during dis charge 18 It has not been established whether this is a new infection reinfection or reactivation There is evidence to demonstrate the presence of neutralizing antibod ies and a cellular immune response in macaques but nothing yet has been estab lished in live humans 18 The follow up question then attempts to determine if these antibodies aid in the clinical outcome of patients While it has been demonstrated in a small nine person study that more antibodies are produced in a more severe case of COVID 19 the relationship between antibody levels and clinical outcome has not been established This is further complicated by the idea that patients with less severe presentations of COVID 19 recover before seroconversion occurs 17 190 Chapter 17 Post Recovery and Long Term Complications Post Recovery Phase of COVID 19 As part of the coronavirus family SARS CoV 2 affects lung function in post recovery especially in severe cases where patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS In one study where 22 16 patients developed ARDS the long term complications were not yet established but experts postulated the poten tial for the virus to develop pulmonary fibrosis 19 A radiology study of 21 patients demonstrated that maximum lung involvement occurs at day 10 post infection which can be easily seen as ground glass opacities with crazy paving patterns on lung CT 20 Additional scans post day 14 have shown a gradual resolution of consoli dation and a decrease in lung involvement hence indicating full recovery On the other hand in another radiology study of 70 patients 66 94 of patients had residual lung disease at hospital discharge with 60 showing ground glass opaci ties on lung CT and 74 showing pure ground glass opacity on lung CT 21 While there is not any clear evidence on post recovery clinical lung outcomes on a more anecdotal basis Dr Owen Tsang Tak yin Medical Director of the authori ty s Infectious Disease Centre at Princess Margaret Hospital in Kwai Chung has noted that some patients experience a 20 30 decrease in lung function post recov ery 22 Given this commentary it is essential that further studies be done both via radiology and via clinically in order to determine the effect of COVID 19 on respi ratory outcomes The next complication that has been found in COVID 19 patients is the develop ment of cardiac complications In a case report of 138 patients 16 7 of patients developed arrhythmia while 7 2 developed some form of acute cardiac injury 23 Other studies have shown that COVID 19 patients present with higher cardiac tro ponin I and BNP levels indicating myocardial involvement 24 25 Additionally anec dotal evidence has shown a higher incidence of cardiac cases such as acute onset heart failure myocardial infarction and myocarditis in COVID 19 patients 23 Given the nature of SARS CoV 2 affecting the heart and cardiovascular system cardiac injury is highly probable and needs to be accounted for in the future COVID 19 treatment There are also neuropsychiatric and central nervous system CNS complications that arise in COVID 19 patients COVID 19 CNS disease has been linked with encephalopathy encephalitis acute disseminated encephalomyelitis meningitis ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke venous sinus thrombosis and endothelialitis 26 In the peripheral nervous system PNS COVID 19 PNS disease has been associated with dysfunction of smell and taste muscle injury and the Guillain Barre syn drome 26 27 These findings and associations suggest that it is important to consider these complications during the post recovery phase and longer term follow up of COVID 19 survivors The final complications that have yet to be studied but need to be addressed in the post recovery phase of COVID 19 are its effect on mental health and quality of life and the development of chronic fatigue syndrome Given the similar findings found between SARS and MERS it is essential to look at these complications in the post recovery phase of COVID 19 Previous epidemics have set the groundwork on what to investigate in months and years after the initial outbreak of SARS CoV 2 191 While the data is quite limited in regard to COVID 19 the similarities and differ ences can be easily seen between the previous two epidemics and the current pan demic This chapter provides an in depth overview of what was found in the SARS and MERS outbreaks that allows for a potential framework that can be used to study the current COVID 19 outbreak This chapter has then identified complications that have been studied and need additional investigation in the current COVID 19 out break As time progresses and further data becomes available it is essential to con tinually build on the foundation that has been set in this chapter References 1 Petrosillo N Viceconte G Ergonul O Ippolito G Petersen E COVID 19 SARS and MERS are they closely

Best Emergency medical services National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Pandemic Preparedness Committee World Health Organization 18 1 Introduction The focus of this chapter is to describe a hospital s response to a coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 outbreak in their area including the ideal personal protective equipment PPE and the protocol necessary for preparation 18 2 Personal Protective Equipment All hospital personnel should have donned PPE prior to entering the room of a patient with COVID 19 This includes but is not limited to the use of eye protec tion gowns face masks respirators and gloves 1 Eye protection Eye protection is necessary to reduce the potential for droplet transmission between the air and the eyes The World Health Organization WHO has found that the use of eye protection is associated with a decreased risk of infec tion 2 It is often not considered but eye protection can be an effective way to reduce the spread of infection in both the community and the hospital setting In the context of a widespread shortage of PPE it is prudent to limit the use of medically appropri ate goggles to health care workers Protection from droplet transmission is only effective if the peripheral areas of the eyes are covered along with the front so 195 protection in the form of splash proof safety goggles or a face shield reaching the front of both ears is recommended Other forms of eye protection such as swim ming goggles or face shield glasses can be used in the community without fear of depleting medical resources In the event of limited supply hospitals may cancel elective procedures that would require the use of eye protection Gowns Since COVID 19 can be spread through fomite transmission it is neces sary for health care personnel to don gowns while treating infected patients Proper disposal of gowns will prevent the virus from being spread by the health care per sonnel s clothing after contact with a patient For this reason ideal gowning should include full length gowns with shoe covers leaving no civilian clothing exposed to the environment of the patient s room This protocol may need to be adjusted depending on availability at individual hospitals The use of polyester or polyester cotton gowns which can be safely washed and reused can help mitigate issues with limited supply Face masks Ideally covering of the mouth should be accomplished through the use of a respirator If respirators are not available or are in short supply a face mask can be used Face masks provide two way protection preventing contact with the health care personnel wearing the mask and preventing the spread by the potentially exposed person wearing the mask Face masks have been shown to dramatically reduce the risk of infection A review by the WHO found that a person wearing a face mask is half as likely to become infected than a person not wearing a face mask 2 A recent study on the rate of transmission before and after mask mandates April 8 to May 15 in 15 US states and the District of Columbia found that mask mandates led to a slowdown in daily COVID 19 growth rate 3 After 5 days the daily growth rate was 0 9 percentage points lower compared to the 5 days prior After 3 weeks the daily growth rate had slowed down by 2 percentage points The authors note that by May 22 as many as 230 000 450 000 cases had been averted 8 The reduction in transmission in a health care setting is even more dramatic with the use of face masks largely due to proper fitting and consistent use Figure 18 1 Despite the increased risk of exposure in a hospital health care workers are 0 30 times as likely to contract the virus as opposed to only half as likely 1 Proper use of face masks can counteract the increased risk of infection In the event of limited supply it is admissible to use face masks past their shelf life If a box of face masks has lasted past its shelf life with no visible degradation of the material it can be used in situations of crisis capacity In the context of COVID 19 the main difference between protecting the airway with a surgical mask and protecting the airway through use of a respirator is related to the size of the coarse particles released from a patient s breath Breath particles are designated either as droplets or as aerosol Droplets are defined as particles greater than 5 m and aerosol consists of particles smaller than 5 m Face masks and respirators provide protection from COVID 19 transmission from both droplets and aerosol but respirators provide a higher degree of protection from aerosol 4 This is particularly important in contexts such as the intubation of an affected COVID 19 patient where the person performing the intubation is more likely to come into contact with aerosolized particles that have a high viral load 196 Personal Protective Equipment PPE and Hospital Preparedness for COVID 19Chapter 18 Personal Protective Equipment PPE and Hospital Preparedness for COVID 19 Personal Protective Equipment 1 4 7 10 13 2 5 8 11 14 3 6 9 12 Figure 18 1 The 14 masks used in the test 7 In the United States there are seven types of particulate filtering face piece res pirators that are approved for use by NIOSH the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 4 They are classified based on two parameters their resistance to oil and the percentage of airborne particles they can filter Those that are not resis tant to oil are classified N those that are somewhat resistant to oil are classified R and those that are strongly resistant to oil are classified P They can filter either at least 95 of airborne particles at least 99 or at least 99 97 designating them by the numbers 95 99 or 100 The seven available types are the N95 the N99 the N100 the R95 the P95 the P99 and the P100 Of these the most widely available and widely used is the N95 The N95 respirator is the standard in the United States for personal airway pro tection and is also approved by the WHO for the purpose of preventing COVID 19 transmission to health care workers The N95 has been shown to be more effective at preventing infection than face masks including single layer 12 layer or 16 layer 197 cotton masks 5 The N95 is comparable to the FFP2 which is certified for use in Europe the KN95 in China the P2 in Australia and New Zealand the Korea 1st class respirator in Korea and the DS2 in Japan 6 Due to availability it is not recom mended for the general public to use them in the event of a pandemic They should be limited to use by health care professionals who need to treat afflicted patients Ideally patients with COVID 19 in hospitals should be placed in rooms with air borne isolation so only the personnel directly in contact with the patients should require the use of respirators This is the most effective way to maximize a limited supply Surgical grade masks are next most protective but they can be costly and con tribute to landfill waste The evidence on homemade cotton masks is still emerging but researchers from Duke University cobbled together a low cost laser device and conducted a study comparing 14 different types of face coverings 7 The results showed that fitted N95 masks followed by surgical masks blocked the greatest amount of droplets N95 masks with valves were less effective Masks made in three layers or more with vacuum cleaner bags or heavy weight quilter s cotton were effective but bandanas and neck fleeces were among the least effective Wearing a neck fleece was actually worse than not wearing anything because the neck fleece actually makes droplets proliferate in the air In COVID 19 viral load peaks in the days before onset of symptoms speaking is enough to dispel virus carrying droplets and asymptomatic people can transmit disease Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and WHO guidance recommends that everyone wear masks to slow down the rate of transmission If 80 of people wear masks it could reduce transmission more than lockdowns and according to the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation if 95 of Americans wear masks then 30 000 deaths can be prevented by October 8 Potential Impact of PPE on Patients PPE such as face masks eye protection and respirators have all been shown to reduce the transmission of COVID 19 and protect health care workers The major downside to the use of such strict PPE pro tocol is the perception of reduced empathy among the patients who are being cared for Some studies have shown that the use of face masks and face shields can lead to less effective communication between care providers and patients and feelings of discomfort among patients Patients experiencing isolation in a hospital are at risk for post intensive care syndrome which can be exacerbated by the lack of exposure to live human faces over an extended period of time 7 Fortunately there are steps we can take to mitigate these issues as well There are many steps health care workers can take to humanize themselves and mitigate the psychological effects of prolonged isolation in patients with COVID 19 Some hospitals have added virtual visits between health care personnel and their patients allowing them an opportunity to interact without PPE Another simple solu tion is the PPE portrait project where health care workers keep disposable pictures of themselves attached to their PPE after donning them so that the patients can asso ciate faces with their caretakers This was started during the Ebola project in Africa and has been implemented in some hospitals in the United States during the COVID 19 project Anecdotally both patients and health care workers have reported feeling a stronger sense of connection due to the introduction of PPE

Laboratory services 18 3 Hospital Preparedness In the event of an emerging pandemic how should a hospital respond What steps need to be taken to ensure preparedness for a potential pandemic What infrastruc ture needs to be in place in order to make sure that a hospital can do its part in miti gating the effects of a COVID 19 outbreak To answer these questions let s look at the response by the fictional Doing It s Best DIB hospital At DIB the Pandemic Preparedness Committee PPC stays in constant contact with the WHO and the CDC as well as global news sources to stay informed of outbreaks everywhere in the world They establish a specific location in the hospital to be the center of coordination in the event of a pandemic This location is equipped with the ability to communicate throughout the hospital as well as the local news government and even the WHO The PPC is organized according to the WHO s hospital preparedness schematic9 shown below Figure 18 2 199 The PPC consists of 11 members one person at the head of the committee and 10 members who are each responsible for one of the key components of the incident response delineated by the above schematic 1 The PPC Communication coordinator is responsible for gathering accurate information and communicating this information to the hospital staff and local community to ensure communal coordinated and evidence based decision making 2 The Continuity coordinator maintains hospital services that must be contin ued and diverts resources away from hospital services that must be postponed in the event of a pandemic 3 The Surge capacity coordinator keeps inventory of the hospital s resources and develops contingency plans for an acute increase in the demand for such resources 4 The HR coordinator ensures adequate staff will be available to respond to a pandemic 5 The Logistics coordinator communicates with DIB s suppliers works in con junction with the Surge capacity coordinator to be aware of inventory and maintains an influx of necessary supplies in the event of an acute increase in need 6 The Essential Support Services coordinator focuses on maintaining the conti nuity of laundry services waste management cleaning and other support services at DIB 7 The Infection Prevention coordinator is responsible for ensuring compliance with infection prevention protocol 8 The Case Management coordinator is responsible for triage of patients 9 The Surveillance coordinator is a trained epidemiologist who maintains con tact with the WHO and CDC s surveillance programs 10 The Laboratory Services coordinator is responsible for ensuring the availabil ity of testing as well as the proper implementation or abstention from the use of tests The head of the PPC oversees all ten areas to ensure a coordinated response Each member trains a prospective replacement who could potentially replace them in the event of an emergency This ensures continuity of decision making if any of the members of the PPC are incapacitated during a pandemic When the Surveillance coordinator identifies an outbreak that may affect their community the Communication coordinator immediately launches an awareness program that informs the hospital personnel about the potential outbreak as well as the key symptoms and history that would lead to the identification of infected patients This is a process that the PPC and the employees would have already been accustomed to because it was set in motion in the event of SARS MERS H1N1 Ebola and other potential outbreaks that never made it to the news cycle The PPC becomes aware of COVID 19 in the early stages of the outbreak through the CDC which is in close contact with the WHO s Global Influenza Programme 200 Personal Protective Equipment PPE and Hospital Preparedness for COVID 19Chapter 18 Personal Protective Equipment PPE and Hospital Preparedness for COVID 19 Hospital Preparedness that facilitates the identification and surveillance of flu like viruses across the world As a result the health care workers at DIB are primed to be on the lookout for any patients with fever malaise and dry cough Any patient presenting with these symp toms can be recognized upon admission and regarded as potentially infected with COVID 19 Prior to the outbreak the Case management coordinator would have already assembled a team of trained hospital personnel who were specifically assigned the task of handling triage in the event of a pandemic As soon as they receive word of an outbreak involving an airborne upper respiratory infection they work with the Surge Capacity and Logistics coordinators to take inventory of face masks and make sure there will be enough available so they can be given to any patients being admitted with symptoms suggesting COVID 19 They in turn train the admission staff to recognize the symptoms of fever malaise and dry cough to maximize the number of people on the lookout for patients that should be offered face masks The waiting areas are reorganized in order to keep patients 6 ft apart as well as direct patients with COVID 19 symptoms to a designated area Simultaneously the PPC contacts local news sources and advertisers who help them spread the aware ness of COVID 19 in their community and encourage patients to utilize phone and Telemedicine consultations in order to minimize the risk of spreading the virus The team also develops a written set of instructions about which patients would require admission testing and potentially be put on a ventilator incorporating consider ations such as age comorbidities and upcoming nonelective surgeries The team is also in constant contact with the local emergency medical services EMS agencies that service DIB in order to identify potential COVID 19 patients being brought via ambulance so that the triage process for them can be done ahead of time Every staff member in the hospital is informed to report potential cases to the PPC and the PPC immediately reports any confirmed case to the local health department and the CDC DIB is prepared to use the proper PPE and to isolate potentially infected patients As soon as a potential COVID 19 patient is identified a systematic communication method relays the information between the front desk admissions and hospital per sonnel responsible for setting up an isolation room complete with an air filtration system to minimize the presence of airborne virions Personnel donned with proper PPE escort the patients to their rooms Potentially infected patients are tested depending on the type of care the patients may need If the patients are young otherwise healthy presenting with mild symp toms not scheduled for an upcoming nonelective surgery or free of any comorbidi ties they are not tested Whether they are positive or negative for the virus these patients are sent home and advised to self quarantine If patients are older function ally limited presenting with severe symptoms scheduled for an upcoming nonelec tive surgery or positive for comorbidities they are tested A positive test means that their hospital stay will continue with isolation protocol The staff at DIB are diligent about preventing spread of the virus within the hos pital from infected patients Every hospital employee who needs to enter an isola tion room does so with proper attire complete with gloves eye protection respirator 201 gown and shoe covers After time spent inside of an isolation room no employee makes contact with the nonisolated section of the hospital without a changing and washing protocol Outside the isolation setting the employees wash their hands regularly practice physical distancing wear surgical masks at all times and are regularly screened for COVID 19 symptoms Let s examine each part of their infec tion prevention plan other than isolation Hygiene Alcohol based foam hand sanitizer dispensers are installed in conve nient locations throughout the hospital and the staff are accustomed to a foam in foam out rule where hands are sanitized before and after every patient encounter Sanitizer is used at least every two hours even without patient encounters Physical Distancing Staff at DIB maintain 6 ft of distance between each other and with patients unless closer contact is necessary for proper medical care Elevator capacities are adjusted to allow passengers to maintain the distance Physical Plexiglas barriers are incorporated at nurse s stations and reception desks Masks The PPC takes inventory of masks and finds that their supply cannot sup port a worsening pandemic So they mandate masks be worn by all health care work ers and all symptomatic patients Once their mask supply is replenished and ready to handle the pandemic all individuals in the hospital are required to wear masks including non health care staff and all patients regardless of symptoms or diagnosis Screening No staff member is allowed in a DIB hospital building if they are posi tive for any symptoms of COVID 19 in the past three days including fever dry cough sore throat or a loss of taste sensation If a staff member has had such symptoms they must have two negative COVID 19 tests before being considered for return to work Over time these infection prevention protocols become a normal part of DIB s culture and are not seen as an inconvenience or imposition on the people who are in the hospital DIB hospital manages to help patients prevent spread of the virus and minimize the death toll of the pandemic until time and new information brought the virus under control What were some key steps that DIB took in order to accomplish this Some key points are below 1 Appoint a committee for the express purpose of pandemic preparedness 2 Maintain a constant communication with the WHO CDC and local health departments 3 Write down a specific plan that describes triage policy changes in the event of a pandemic as well as plans on how to train personnel about recognizing potentially infected patients 4 Train and rehearse the plan 5 Implement the plan before a pandemic arrives in the local area 6 Communicate with local news sources and spread information about the pan demic to the local community 7 Maintain a strict protocol to prevent nosocomial infections involving a com prehensive plan incorporating strict hygiene protocol physical distancing mandatory wearing of face masks and regular screening for COVID 19 symptoms 202 Personal Protective Equipment PPE and Hospital Preparedness for COVID 19Chapter 18 Personal Protective Equipment PPE and Hospital Preparedness for COVID 19 References Dr Atul Gawande recommends four pillars to effectively stem the spread of COVID 19 hygiene distancing screening and masks 10 The fifth pillar in Dr Gawande s strategy is culture in hospitals and general community settings that requires people to care about their own safety as well as the safety of others 11 It means following rules

Organization 19 1 Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS CoV 2 has emerged as an unprecedented public health threat As an airborne virus it is largely transmitted via respiratory droplets with the first symptoms appearing around 5 days after infection ranging from 2 to 14 days 1 However unlike other coronaviruses a sizable portion of person to per son transmission of SARS CoV 2 occurs before infected individuals develop symp toms presymptomatic or never develop any symptoms asymptomatic 2 A country s ability to contain COVID 19 outbreaks depends on identifying and isolating positive cases and quarantining their contacts Large scale diagnostic test ing is essential since it allows countries to track viral spread within communities to safely reopen economies and return life to the new normal and to better manage clinical progression of illness Early detection of COVID 19 can aid in the 205 management of patients and prevent deaths This chapter focuses on diagnostic test ing currently available for COVID 19 and assesses their effectiveness in accurately detecting positive cases 19 2 Background The genomic sequence of the SARS CoV 2 was released on January 10 2020 3 and it was soon followed by four other genomes deposited two days later in the viral sequence database curated by the Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza Data GISAID 4 As a result of this early sharing of the genome companies and research groups across the world quickly worked toward developing diagnostic test kits Researchers from Germany at the German Center for Infection Research DZIF 5 at Charit in Berlin developed the first laboratory assay to detect the virus that served as the basis for the first diagnostic kits shipped by the World Health Organization WHO to its regional offices on February 2 along with guidance on their use 6 Aggressive testing in Hong Kong Republic of South Korea Singapore and Taiwan helped to contain transmission discussed in Chapter 23 Even European countries relied on scaling up testing to contain outbreaks isolate infected individuals and quarantine their contacts The WHO recommended that governments test as many people as possible and that the rate of positivity in testing should remain at 5 or lower for at least 14 days before reopening and lifting stay at home orders and lockdowns 7 19 3 Types of Tests NAAT Antibody and Antigen Two types of diagnostic tests were being used to detect COVID 19 First the real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RT PCR a nucleic acid amplification test NAAT and second serological tests that rely on host immuno globulin G IgG or IgM interleukins and other host components The RT PCR considered the gold standard was usually done by swabbing the nose or mouth for the virus From the swab sample a specific section of the viral genome reverse transcribes the viral ribonucleic acid RNA into deoxyribonucleic acid DNA and amplifies it through PCR to detectable amounts of the virus The test requires a laboratory and can also be carried out on automated platforms known as point of care diagnostic testing like the Abbott ID NOW The results can take several hours to complete and RT PCR testing requires test kits and materials from nose swabs to chemical reagents as well as trained health care professionals to administer 8 RT PCR testing is nearly 100 accurate but its accuracy depends on the amount of viral RNA present in the sample which can depend on a variety of factors such as the timing of the test and the start of infection and or onset of symptoms the swabbing technique and the location of the samples The viral load samples based on location from within patients can vary In COVID 19 positive patients test results determined by RT PCR report the following levels from samples 93 from 206 Chapter 19 Testing for COVID 19 Types of Tests NAAT Antibody and Antigen the bronchoalveolar lavage BAL 72 from sputum 63 from nasal swab 32 from pharyngeal swab 29 from feces 1 in blood and 0 in urine 9 Scaling up RT PCR can be expensive However recently a saliva test SalivaDirect instead of respiratory swabs is under consideration by the FDA for approval The test is inex pensive 1 29 4 37 and doesn t require as many material inputs The other test for COVID 19 also under use are the serological tests that detect viral specific antibodies IgM or IgG The presence of antibodies seroconversion takes time depending on severity of the illness and the individual s immune sys tem 10 Antibodies are typically uniformly distributed in the blood and therefore there is less variation Virus specific antibody IgM rises 3 days after the onset of symptoms and begins to disappear as the patient recovers IgG which typically rises 10 to 11 days after the onset of symptoms remains in circulation long after the infection Serological tests are useful in determining if an individual ever had COVID 19 and should not be used to diagnose current infection because of the slow pace of the antibody response or cross reactivity with other infections includ ing those caused by other human coronaviruses Tests administered too soon when the immune response is evolving can result in inaccuracies discussed next At the population level antibody tests offer a few advantages over RT PCR test ing Serological tests are easier to administer requiring a small amount of blood and tend to be less sensitive to spoilage during collection transport storage and analy sis Antibody testing is also important for understanding the overall prevalence of COVID 19 in a community or for purposes of population level studies Together these two types of tests can be helpful in determining clinical signifi cance of a patient exposed to COVID 19 infection Table 19 1 11 A note of caution in the absence of longitudinal data it is not clear if the presence of antibodies con fers long term immunity see Chapter 2 and it would be well advised to maintain protective measures Table 19 1 Diagnostic Testing and Clinical Outcome at the Individual Level Test Results Clinical Outcome RT PCR IgM IgG Patient is in incubation period of infection Patient is in early stages of infection Patient is in active disease Patient is in late stage of infection Patient could be in early stage of infection RT PCR result may be false negative Patient may have had COVID 19 and has recovered Patient may be in the recovery stage RT PCR result may be false negative 207 The currently available as well as emerging diagnostic tests are conveniently summarized at the Mass General website https csb mgh harvard edu covid Antigen tests for COVID 19 can reveal if a person is currently infected with SARS CoV 2 Almost as accurate as RT PCR but with much less sensitivity anti gen tests detect proteins or glycans like the spike proteins on the surface These tests take longer to develop than molecular and antibody tests because suitable anti bodies for use in the assays must first be identified and produced But antigen tests are rapid and relatively cheap and more amenable to point of care technology The FDA has approved one antigen test from Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay FIA https www quidel com immunoassays rapid sars tests sofia sars antigen fia which takes 15 min COVID 19 has triggered innovation in diagnostic thinking For example the use of genome editing technology CRISPR developed for cancer treatment is being used for detecting COVID 19 CRISPR based tests rely on nucleic acid extraction and amplification and can detect as few as 100 coronavirus particles in a swab or saliva sample and they don t require many specialty reagents or materials 12 The tests are administered through cartridge like devices and provide results within an hour which makes them attractive to use in a variety of settings Although CRISPR tests are based on RT PCR they tend to produce slightly more false negatives in compari son Nonetheless CRISPR based diagnostics could be an important step toward safely reopening society The FDA on May 7 approved the first CRISPR based diagnostic product Sherlock Biosciences 1 h test for SARS CoV 2 13 Mammoth Biosciences and GlaxoSmithKline are working on a 20 min CRISPR based test There are other radical ideas using nanobiotechnology biophotonics and nanoflu ids 14 For example researchers are working on facemasks embedded with biosensors that could detect the presence of virus or other devices that could display the virus on piece of silicone or paper It is likely that the next wave of diagnostics could emerge from the intersection of physical and engineering sciences and biology The US Congress has doubled the annual budget of the US National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering NIBIB by an additional 500 million and at the same time the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA is funding two CRISPR projects that could deliver low cost high volume point of care tests The US Center for Disease Control CDC has developed a new laboratory test that can detect SARS CoV 2 and influenza A and B viruses at the same time 15 The CDC Influenza SARS CoV 2 Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay allows laboratories to con tinue influenza surveillance while testing for COVID 19 and conserves important testing materials that are in short supply The Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay was issued an Emergency Use Authorization on July 2 2020 19 4 Sensitivity Specificity and Accuracy in Testing In COVID 19 diagnostic testing accuracy matters and interpreting test results can be challenging 16 Validity of a test is measured in terms of its sensitivity and specific ity Table 19 2 Sensitivity is the test s ability to identify those with infection and 208 Chapter 19 Testing for COVID 19 Interpretation of Tests Understanding Predictive Values Table 19 2 Determining Sensitivity Specificity and Accuracy Disease Yes Disease No Test positive Test negative True positive TP False positive FP False negative FN True negative TN Sensitivity TP TP FN Specificity TN FP TN Accuracy TP TN TP FP TN FN antibodies true positives positive test in a patient with disease Sensitivity levels of tests are very important because patients who are infected but diagnosed as not having COVID 19 can continue to infect others and spread the disease Specificity is the test s ability to identify those without infection true negatives negative test in a healthy individual In the case of individuals who are not infected but deter mined to be disease positive there are not as many concerns in terms of transmis sion but people could erroneously assume immunity when that is not the case Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions true positives and true nega tives among the total number of cases examined Accuracy is based upon the inher ent value of the test and a higher accuracy of a test reflects a combination of higher sensitivity and specificity note the term accuracy in layman s term differs and is more vague from the term as defined here as used in statistics The NAATs typically have high sensitivity and specificity under ideal condi tions but in clinical reality these measures can vary and depend on the quality of specimen collection the viral load and duration of illness RT PCR is a good con firmatory test but according to researchers false negative results people who are positive for COVID 19 but test negative are more common than initially thought In one study from Johns Hopkins 1 in 5 persons was found to have a false negative result 17 A systematic review reported false negative rates between 2 and 29 equating sensitivity to 71 98 18 Antibody tests are increasingly available but tend to be less accurate The Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics FIND a global nonprofit organization conducted an independent evaluation of SARS CoV 2 antibody diagnostic tests https www finddx org covid 19 dx data and observed that range was between 25 and 75 for sensitivity In the United States the FDA had initially loosened its standards allowing companies to sell antibody tests without submitting clinical evi dence on the accuracy of the test but it has recently tightened regulations 19 19 5 Interpretation of Tests Understanding Predictive Values Negative and positive predictive values must be considered in interpretations of a COVID 19 test A negative predictive value is the proportion of true negative results with total negative results A positive predictive value also known as precision is the proportion of true positive results with the total number of positive results 209 Table 19 3 Predictive Powers of a Test with 90 Sensitivity and Specificity 5 Prevalence 20 Test Result People with Disease People without Disease Total Positive Negative Total 4500 500 5000 9500 85 500 95 000 14 000 86 000 100 000 Predictive value

along with the prevalence of disease 20 while accuracy remains fixed Consider a hypothetical situation with a test with 90 sensitivity specificity and accuracy In a community of 100 000 people with 5 prevalence of disease 5000 positive cases and 90 sensitivity and specificity there would still be 500 false negatives and 9500 false positives Table 19 3 and the predictive value of a positive test would only be 32 meaning 68 would receive incorrect information In contrast in a similar com munity of 100 000 people with 25 prevalence of disease 25 000 positive cases and 90 sensitivity and specificity there would be 2 500 false negatives and 7500 false positives Table 19 4 with a predictive value of a positive test of 75 mean ing 25 would receive incorrect information Sensitivity specificity and accuracy vary among antibody tests and their inter pretation based upon predictive values must also take into account the prevalence of COVID 19 in a community or country For a more visual depiction of this concept please see https www youtube com watch v qtlSu7OhkYE feature youtu be 19 6 Conclusion In conclusion testing for COVID 19 is critical for containing the disease and safely opening countries Countries need to put in place testing strategies and use tests that are validated for realistic conditions It is important to start testing asymptomatic 210 Chapter 19 Testing for COVID 19 References people who can unknowingly spread COVID 19 Given the uncertainty regarding immunity all those testing positive for COVID 19 should still maintain protective measures such as wearing masks practicing hand hygiene and refraining from large gatherings Diagnostic tests should be affordable and easy to use especially those for screen ing and for determining prevalence Serological surveys should be performed regu larly in high risk communities and situations Diagnostic interpretation of tests must take into consideration not only the inherent accuracy of the tests but also the preva lence of COVID 19 in the community or country As new diagnostic methods come forward all people should have equal access to these emerging technological tools References 1 Lauer SA

Ribonucleic acid 20 1 Introduction The treatments for COVID 19 can be split up into different categories It should be noted that there are no FDA approved drugs for the treatment of COVID 19 However all treatments right now are experimental There have been no clinical data that demonstrates benefits with any of these drugs but the information on drug treatment is rapidly evolving Many of these drugs were developed prior to the pan demic and have been repurposed from their intended use to treat COVID 19 patients while some are new compounds Table 20 1 213 Table 20 1 Summary of New and Repurposed Existing Compounds for COVID 19 Treatment Classification Antiviral Drug Remdesivir Lopinavir Ritonavir Favipiravir Oseltamivir Antimalarial Hydroxychloroquine chloroquine Antibiotics

experimental therapy that has been postulated This is when blood is donated from patients who have previously recovered from the virus and the antibodies are then administered to a person who hasn t recovered This is potentially a pre or post exposure prophylaxis treatment rather than the treatment of acute illness This procedure has been researched for many years with different viruses but there is very limited data showing its efficacy for COVID 19 Please see the following chart from MGH summarizing the significant trials and results 215 Author Virus Methodology N Primary Result Soo 2004 7

had adverse events No significant difference in survival between groups Recently there was one trial that showed out of the five patients that received a transfusion the viral load decreased and the patients clinically improved However there are flaws in this treatment because it takes a lot of resources and is expensive Therefore as for any of the treatments additional research needs to be done to weigh the pros and cons 20 3 Antiviral Antiretroviral 20 3 1 Remdesivir Remdesivir RDV is a broad spectrum antiviral which inhibits viral RNA polymer ases by incorporating an adenosine analogue into nascent RNA chains causing pre mature termination 1 Gordon Tchesnokov Woolner et al 2020 recently proved that the triphosphate form of RDV effectively inserts into the RNA polymerase of MERS CoV 2 This mechanism was shown to occur even more efficiently than natu ral nucleotide pools making RDV an attractive candidate for further research for targeting SARS CoV 2 An in vitro study by Wang et al 2020 corroborates this mechanism against SARS CoV 2 in Vero E6 cells at a stage post virus entry 3 Researchers suggested RDV to be effective in nonhuman primates at its working concentration 216 Chapter 20 Drugs for Treating COVID 19 Antiviral Antiretroviral Much investigation is underway to determine the efficacy of RDV for treating COVID 19 4 Published studies show promising results showing shorter recovery times and clinical improvement yet one study found no significant clinical benefits 5 In a randomized double blind placebo controlled multicenter trial it was found that the drug was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits However there was a reduction in time to clinical improvement that warrants further confirmation This was the first study of its kind assessing the effect of intravenous RDV for COVID 19 published in late April 6 Another study was published in late May which was also double blind ran domized and placebo controlled Researchers conducted trials of intravenous RDV in adults hospitalized with COVID 19 It was found that RDV led to shorter times to recovery than placebo 7 A study published in the NEJM investigated the compassionate use of RDV on patients hospitalized with COVID 19 8 Patients were intravenously given a 10 day course of RDV Clinical improvement was defined as live discharge from the hospital a decrease of at least 2 points from baseline on a modified ordinal scale as recommended by the WHO R D Blueprint Group 8 or both It was concluded that RDV led to a clinical improvement of 36 of 53 patients 68 RDV is one of the few drugs to show benefit in COVID 19 Importantly RDV is an investigational drug and is not FDA approved for any indication at the present time It was only given to hospitalized patients on a compassionate use basis in late January and in clinical trials since February Initially the US Department of Health and Human Services was the sole allocator of the drug during a five month period As of October 1 2020 its distribution responsibilities have been returned to the hands of Gilead Sciences Inc On May 1 2020 the FDA issued Veklury remdesivir for treatment of hospital ized patients with severe COVID 19 Patients with severe disease were defined as patients with oxygen saturation SpO2 94 on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen or requiring mechanical ventilation or requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO On August 28 2020 the FDA reissued the May 1st letter and expanded the authorized use of the drug Now its use is no longer limited to patients with severe coronavirus disease 20 3 2 Lopinavir Ritonavir Lopinavir and ritonavir are two structurally related protease inhibitors that are coad ministered or coformulated Lopinavir is a selective inhibitor of the human immu nodeficiency virus HIV 1 protease arresting its maturation and decreasing further infectivity Ritonavir has a similar activity however not as effective due to the initial hepatic metabolism The purpose of coadministration is for low dose ritonavir to 217 inhibit metabolic inactivation of lopinavir acting mainly as an enhancer in an enzy matic kinetics context 9 This drug combination is widely used for treating HIV 1 infections ultimately by suppressing plasma viral load Pre pandemic literature shows evidence of lopinavir ritonavir leading to better clinical outcomes for treating SARS 10 As of June 24 2020 there are 28 active trials that include the usage of lopinavir ritonavir as a primary or control treatment for COVID 19 ClinicalTrials gov 2020 There is evidence of some effectiveness with use of lopinavir ritonavir as part of a combination with other drugs however further confirmation is required A nota ble study found a triple combination of interferon beta 1b lopinavir ritonavir and ribavirin to alleviate symptoms and shorten hospital stay for COVID 19 patients 11 In another study however Cao et al 2020 found no benefit to a lopinavir ritonavir treatment compared to standard care Researchers conducted a randomized con trolled open label trial in 199 hospitalized patients with COVID 19 with points of comparison time to clinical improvement mortality and detectable viral RNA NIH guidelines also advise against lopinavir ritonavir and other HIV protease inhibitors for COVID 19 due to pharmacodynamic evidence of insufficient drug levels when taken orally 12 13 The NIH also cited the previously mentioned trial by Cao et al 2020 in their justification 20 3 3 Favipiravir Favipiravir FPV targets viral replication and transcription by acting as a pseudo purine nucleic acid thereby selectively inhibiting RNA dependent RNA poly merase It is potent against strains of influenza virus arena bunya and flaviviruses as well as members of the alphavirus paramyxovirus and norovirus families It is also useful for viruses that are resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors 14 There are cur rently a few clinical trials assessing the efficacy of FPV for treating COVID 19 A study comparing FPV to the control group administered lopinavir ritonavir found significant clinical differences in median viral clearance time 4 vs 11 days as well as in the improvement of chest imaging 15 Meanwhile another study found no significant benefits to FPV in comparison with umifenovir 16 20 3 4 Oseltamivir Tamiflu Oseltamivir once converted to oseltamivir carboxylate after ingestion is a neur aminidase enzyme inhibitor 17 By binding to the active site of neuraminidase enzyme progeny virions may not be released from the infected cell greatly reduc ing the spread of the virus 18 However the use of oseltamivir as a potential drug for SARS CoV 1 was also explored prior to the COVID 19 pandemic with unpromis ing results 19 Despite this there are currently multiple phase III trials involving osel tamivir some of which are in combination with other drugs such as FPV and hydroxychloroquine HC 20 218 Chapter 20 Drugs for Treating COVID 19 Antimalarial Hydroxychloroquine Chloroquine 20 3 5 SNG001 SNG001 is an inhaled medication that delivers interferon to a patient s lungs 21 Interferon is released by the body in response to an infection and possesses mul tiple antiviral properties 19 A recent trial of 101 participants suggests that adminis tering SNG001 reduced patients chances of progressing to a more severe state by 79 21 The drug is thought to boost inherent antiviral processes in patients espe cially those that have reduced interferon production due to age or other condi tions 22 A larger double blinded controlled phase II trial with 400 participants is currently being conducted 23 20 4 Antimalarial Hydroxychloroquine Chloroquine Chloroquine CQ and HC are antimalarial agents CQ is used mainly for treating malaria and amebiasis while HC is used mainly to treat rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus 24 They function as antima larials by down regulation of the immune response against autoantigens This occurs by disrupting the normal formation of peptide MHC protein complexes which acti vate T cells as a consequence of interference with endolysosomal function and thus the processing of antigens in macrophages and other antigen presenting cells 25 There has been much hype and controversy surrounding the use of HC to prevent or treat COVID 19 Also something to note are its well publicized endorsements by the US president and billionaire Elon Musk An early French study26 evaluating HC and HC with azithromycin seemed promising but has since been widely scrutinized for validity27 even by the president of the journal that published it 28 Another early study which was done in China was initially touted as evidence for the efficacy of HC29 but was later questioned due to its lack of peer review These factors may have partly led to an increase in research trials as well as an uptick in the public actively seeking out these drugs in late April and May this year30 As of late June there are more than 200 clinical trials studying the efficacy of CQ HC and HC in combina tion with azithromycin ClinicalTrials gov 2020 More evidence is surfacing that CQ and HC are not effective for treating COVID 19 The FDA previously cautioned against their use for SARS CoV 2 due to risk of heart rhythm problems QT interval prolongation31 ventricular tachycar dia Their latest stance given on June 15th is that of strong opposition as the FDA has revoked its emergency use authorization EUA They cite a large randomized clinical trial which showed no evidence of reducing likelihood of death or increasing recovery time as well as more recent data showing that the recommended dose did not kill or inhibit the virus 32 Published in late May a meta analysis of 23 studies concludes that the evi dence for use of HC or CQ to treat COVID 19 is weak and conflicting 33 The studies included did not evaluate its use as a prophylactic 219 A paper was published in the Lancet which suggested that the use of HC for COVID 19 patients increased hazard for heart problems and death 34 Its findings led to alarm in the health and medical research community that caused some clinical trials to stop 35 The article has since been retracted after researchers were unable to allow an independent peer review due to confiden tiality agreements 34 In June researchers announced conclusions of the large randomized trial Recovery Randomized Evaluation of COVID 19 thERapY stating that they found no clinical benefit of the use of HC in treating the disease 1542 patients were given HC and compared to 3132 patients who received usual care No significant difference was observed in patient mortality or hospital stay duration 36 In mid May an observational study of 1376 patients was conducted in a large hospital in New York City Clinical outcomes were compared between patients who were given HC and those who were not Results showed no significant benefits of HC use in decreasing or increasing risk of intubation or death 37 Prophylaxis with HC has also been investigated and no benefits were identified A randomized and controlled study with 2250 participants was done in Barcelona Spain Researchers evaluated the use of HC as a tool for post expo sure prophylaxis PEP 38 It was found that there was no significant difference between the treatment and control groups in developing COVID 19 35 Another study published in early June by researchers in Minnesota conducted a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial to determine PEP effi cacy of HC The study enrolled 821 participants who had had high risk expo sure to COVID 19 patients Researchers found no statistically significant difference in incidence of COVID 19 between the HC and placebo groups when taken 4 days after exposure 39 20 5 Antibiotics 20 5 1 Azithromycin Azithromycin s antibacterial activity comes from its ability to interfere with bacte rial protein synthesis by binding to the 50s ribosome subunit 40 Although it is pre scribed for bacterial infections and not viral it does have anti inflammatory and antiviral properties which may be beneficial in treating COVID 19 patients 41 43 The NIH is currently funding a study that is determining whether azithromycin administered with HC results in a better outcome 44 This trial is in its second phase of clinical trials 45 There are also numerous trials looking into other possible 220 Chapter 20 Drugs for Treating COVID 19 Monoclonal Antibodies beneficial uses such as proactive care in ambulances outpatient treatment and whether azithromycin alone can improve outcomes in COVID 19 patients 46 48 20 5 2 Clofazimine Clofazimine is an antibiotic that has been traditionally used to treat tuberculosis and leprosy which also possess anti inflammatory properties An in vitro study clofazi mine appears to have reduced the viral load There is a phase II study further explor ing clofazimine s possible role in treating SARS CoV 2 infections including a possible combination therapy with interferon 1b 20 6 Monoclonal Antibodies 20 6 1 Tocilizumab Actemra and Sarilumab Kevzara Tocilizumab Actemra and sarilumab Kevzara are both antibodies that target the human receptor for IL 6 which has been known to be produced at inflammatory sites and to play a key role in chronic inflammation 49 50 A large release of IL 6 has also been observed in cytokine storms and it was speculated that an IL 6 blocker could be used to treat them 50 Initial reports of tocilizumab seemed as a promising compound in alleviating effects of cytokine storms and improving clinical outcomes among COVID 19 patients 51 52 This has led to numerous studies on tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID 19 53 Tocilizumab s promising results have also led the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to invest 25 million dollars in phase III trials 54 There are also two clinical trials looking into tocilizumab s therapeutic effects in conjunction with RDV and HC 55 56 Despite sarilumab s similarity with tocilizumab initial results reported by Regeneron and Sanofi the manufacturers and developers of sarilumab were not as promising and only those deemed critically will advance to phase III studies 57 20 6 2 Canakinumab Ilaris Canakinumab is a monoclonal antibody against human IL 1 a pro inflammatory cytokine 58 59 This drug has traditionally been used to treat mainly immune and inflammatory disorders such as cryopyrin associated periodic syndrome and Muckle Wells syndrome 58 60 This drug has been used to treat patients suffering from hyperinflammation due to COVID 19 however without a study with larger samples and controls its true efficacy is not well known 61 There are currently phase III trials being conducted by Novartis the developer of canakinumab exploring the efficacy of canakinumab in patients with COVID 19 induced pneumonia that is experiencing cytokine release syndrome CRS 62 63 221 20 6 3 Leronlimab Leronlimab is a humanized antibody for chemokine receptor CCR5 and was ini tially developed for HIV treatment 64 The company CytoDyn that developed this drug has been also exploring other applications such as COVID 19 treatment 65 Researchers are hoping that by binding antibodies to CCR5 cytokine production can be reduced which can then alleviate the adverse effects of cytokine storms in COVID 19 patients 65 Initial results reported by the company showed signs of clinical improvement and relative safety 65 As of July 29 2020 there is a phase II double blind controlled study with 390 participants being sponsored by CytoDyn 66 20 7 Kinase Inhibitor 20 7 1 Acalabrutinib Calquence Acalabrutinib is an irreversible second generation Bruton s tyrosine kinase BTK inhibitor 67 BTK is an important player in B cell maturation dendritic cell regula tion cytokine production and phagocytosis 68 Therefore it has been used to treat malignancies that are B cell in origin 69 This also makes acalabrutinib an immuno suppressive so it is being investigated for treating COVID 19 68 There are currently two clinical trials that are in phase II seeing if the drug can reduce mortality in COVID 19 patients 70 20 7 2 Baricitinib Olumiant Baricitinib is a selective inhibitor for JAK1 JAK2 that has been commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis 71 These Janus kinase JAK proteins initiate an activation cascade that eventually alters cellular transcription and have been associated with inflammation 72 This connection is thought to be caused by the activation of JAK proteins via cytokine receptors 72 This drug may also provide antiviral properties 73 Baricitinib also binds to AP2 associated protein kinase 1 which may affect endocy tosis and reduce viral entry 73 However some have stated that to see this effect requires doses that are much higher than therapeutic doses 74 There are currently multiple clinical trials for COVID 19 taking place in mul tiple countries some of which are looking to see the effects of combining barici tinib with other medications such as with lopinavir ritonavir and RDV 75 76 Although an initial report suggests promising outcomes when using the barici tinib the same report recognizes that the study had a small sample size and no randomization 73 There are a couple of features that make baricitinib different from ruxolitinib despite both being first generation of JAK inhibitors 77 Baricitinib is not 222 Chapter 20 Drugs for Treating COVID 19 Immunomodulator Anakinra Kineret metabolized by cytochrome P450 and can be excreted by the kidney while the opposite is true for ruxolitinib 77 20 7 3 Tofacitinib Xeljanz Tofacitinib is a JAK inhibitor that specifically targets JAK1 JAK3 and to a lesser extent JAK2 77 Tofacitinib has been used to treat a wide array of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease and other dermatological disorders 77 There are currently at least four clinical trials looking into tofacitinib as a form of treatment in patients with COVID 19 one of which is comparing the drug effects to using HC alone 78 79 20 7 4 Ruxolitinib Jakafi Ruxolitinib is a kinase inhibitor that targets JAK1 JAK2 80 This JAK inhibitor has been mainly used to treat myelofibrosis a form of cancer affecting the bone mar row 78 Due to its anti inflammatory properties there are currently phase III trials and other studies looking into ruxolitinib in treating cytokine storms associated with COVID 19 81 82 20 7 5 Apilimod Apilimod is phosphatidylinositol 3 phosphate 5 kinase PIKfyve inhibitor and seems to influence the maturation and function of endosomes Its possible roles in treating B cell non Hodgkin s lymphoma lysosomal dysfunction related disorders and viral infections have been explored prior to SARS CoV 2 A study published in July 2020 suggests that the drug may also be useful in preventing the entry of SARS CoV 2 into human cells as well as replication There is currently a phase II clinical trial involving COVID 19 outpatients with mild symptoms 20 8 Immunomodulator Anakinra Kineret Anakinra acts as an IL 1 receptor antagonist 83 It has been mainly prescribed for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoinflammatory conditions 84 There have been reports where the drug has been reported to reduce systemic inflamma tion and alleviate pulmonary symptoms in some COVID 19 patients 85 86 There are currently multiple clinical trials exploring the drug s efficacy 84 This drug may help reduce mortality as there are reports of hyperinflammation and cytokine storms resulting in mortality of COVID 19 patients 87 223 20 9 Nonspecific Anti inflammatory 20 9 1 Dexamethasone Dexamethasone is a steroid that works as an anti inflammatory and immunosup pressive by acting as a glucocorticoid agonist 88 Results of a randomized clinical trial involving 2104 patients seem encouraging as results show that daily adminis tration of the drug 6 mg either orally or by IV reduced morality by a third in ven tilated patients and by a fifth in patients receiving only oxygen 89 However experts have urged caution as the official papers detailing the results have not been pub lished 90 The World Health Organization and other countries have previously expressed reservations of using steroids in treating COVID 19 patients since ste roids may suppress the immune system to a higher extent than desired but they have indicated that these results may change WHO clinical guidelines 91 92 If further data reinforces the benefits of dexamethasone this steroid which is considered inexpen sive and widely available may become a key drug in saving many lives 92 20 9 2 Methylprednisolone Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid that is based on prednisolone a glucocorti coid but it is reported to have a higher potency than prednisolone and to have a potency that is five times greater than hydrocortisone in its anti inflammatory prop erties 93 The use of methylprednisolone in treating COVID 19 patients with ARDS as well as preventing the worsening of clinical symptoms has been suggested 94 A study of 173 participants in Italy has led the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases to recommend doctors in considering the use of methylpred nisolone in patients that begin to have worsening respiratory functions 95 Another study of 213 participants by Henry Ford Health System also seems to suggest that the use of methylprednisolone can improve outcomes and help prevent worsening of respiratory functions 94 More studies are being conducted including one by the Mayo clinic to further support the use of methylprednisolone 96 20 9 3 Ciclesonide Ciclesonide is a glucocorticoid that reduces inflammation by reducing vasodilation vascular permeability and the accumulation of leukocytes and macrophages 97 It has been regularly used as an inhaled corticosteroid and there were some early reports suggesting ciclesonide as an effective candidate for treating SARS CoV 2 induced pneumonia 98 101 However there are claims that it is not clear whether or not inhaled corticosteroid is an effective treatment in patients with COVID 19 102 There are cur rently multiple clinical trials taking place in Asia Europe and North America including a phase III clinical trial with 400 participants in the United States 103 224 Chapter 20 Drugs for Treating COVID 19 Antiparasitic 20 9 4 Budesonide Formoterol Budesonide is a glucocorticoid steroid that can be delivered via oral inhalation 104 Formoterol a long acting beta agonist works as a bronchodilator and is routinely administered with budesonide in asthma patients 102 105 The NIH is funding a phase III clinical trial of this drug combination in patients with acute respiratory failure including cases involving COVID 19 106 20 10 Anti Inflammatory Colchicine Colchicine is a compound that is extracted from plants belonging to the Colchis genus and has been used to treat a variety of conditions including inflammatory ones such as pericarditis 107 The compound s anti inflammatory properties can come from multiple mechanisms 107 Some of which include the reduction in the secretion of certain cytokines such as IL 1 IL 8 and IL 18 107 109 A recent study published from Greece consisting of 105 patients suggests that colchicine may be considered as a possible treatment 110 However even the authors of this paper noted that this data is hypothesis generating and more studies are needed 110 There are currently multiple phase III trials looking into colchicine including one that is double blinded controlled and with 6000 participants being conducted in parts of the United States Canada and Spain 111 20 11 Antiparasitic 20 11 1 Nitazoxanide Nitazoxanide is an antiparasitic drug that targets pyruvate ferredoxin flavodoxin oxidoreductase electron transfer 112 Although initially developed as an anti proto zoan drug the compound has also shown to reduce replication in RNA and deoxy ribonucleic acid DNA viruses including ones that are resistant to oseltamivir 113 There are currently phase III clinical trials where researchers are seeking to deter mine if nitazoxanide can serve as a safe prophylaxis in health care workers and the elderly 114 115 20 11 2 Ivermectin Ivermectin targets invertebrate glutamate gated chloride channels inducing an influx in chloride 116 Studies in the past have also indicated that the drug may have antiviral properties causing others to express the possibility of ivermectin as a pos sible candidate for treating COVID 19 patients 117 This has led to multiple ivermec tin based clinical trials including one by Johns Hopkins University 118 225 20 12 Radiation Low dose radiation has been used to treat conditions like pneumonia before the advent of antibiotics and it is thought to work by inducing anti inflammatory pro cesses 119 120 The use of low dose whole lung radiation seems to have improved the condition of some COVID 19 patients 119 On June 16th 2020 a phase III trial was first posted which seeks to determine whether low dose whole lung radiation can be better than the current best supportive practices 121 References 1 Dong L Hu S Gao J Discovering drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 Drug

virus disease Middle East respiratory syndrome viral like particle 21 1 Introduction This chapter will briefly discuss viral technologies and categories relevant to corona virus disease COVID 19 vaccine candidates which will include advantages dis advantages and strategies to illicit immunity for each type of vaccine mentioned The availability possible risks and how mutations may affect the efficacy of these vaccines will also be briefly touched upon 21 2 What Are Viral Vaccines Viral vaccines are prepared substances that seek to prevent the manifestation of a disease that is viral in origin and to prevent the further spread of a viral pathogen 1 There are multiple different types of vaccines based on their composition and some of these types are adenovirus vector mRNA DNA live attenuated inactivated and subunit 1 Vaccines are considered as the primary method for preventing viral infec tions 1 Vaccinations have been used to contain epidemics and are considered a vital tool in reducing mortality in a pandemic 2 21 3 What Are the Risks Associated with Viral Vaccines The risk a viral vaccine may have is dependent on the type of vaccine as well as the patient s condition 3 In the case of live vaccines patients who are sufficiently immu nocompromised should not receive some vaccines as they may lead to an adverse 235 reaction or result 3 The contents of the vaccine can also pose a risk in some individu als as they can lead to an allergic reaction some of which may lead to asphyxiation 4 In other rare cases vaccine recipients have actually become more susceptible to infection or a more severe manifestation of the disease 5 6 This phenomenon is called immune enhancement 6 Although studies suggest immune enhancement may be unlikely for SARS CoV 2 vaccine candidates it is a concern that is plausible enough for experts to express the need to monitor for enhancement during trials and to determine the possibility of enhancement 6 7 21 4 SARS CoV 2 Vaccines in Development and WHO Database As of September 25 2020 approximately 42 potential COVID 19 vaccines are being tested in various stages of clinical trials 8 Over a hundred more are in the pre clinical phase in development 8 The World Health Organization has a periodically updated table detailing the type of vaccine its developer and its current stage of development Table 21 1 8 https www who int who documents detail draft landscape of covid 19 candidate vaccines 21 4 1 Viral Vector Vaccines and Adenoviral Vector Vaccines Viral vector vaccines exploit the existing viral mechanisms to transport genetic material into the vaccine recipient s cells to express an antigen 9 These viral vector vaccines can be further differentiated into nonreplicating and replicating versions 9 An advantage of a replicating viral vector vaccine is dosage sparing and a stronger immune response which may allow for more vaccines to be available 9 There are currently 40 viral vector vaccines being developed for SARS CoV 2 based on the following viruses the pox virus the paramyxovirus the alpha virus the vaccinia virus the influenza virus and the adenovirus 8 The first vaccine to enter phase III of clinical trials is an adenoviral vector vaccine developed by Oxford University s Jenner Institute 8 Published data also shows that this vaccine can produce antibodies and a cellular response in recipients who received doses in April 2020 10 An adenoviral vector vaccine utilizes the adenovirus which is a double strand DNA nonenveloped virus 11 Due to its genetic make up concerns of integration were expressed but studies show that adenoviral vector vaccines remain largely unintegrated 11 Adenoviral vector vaccines have also been attenuated and its vector has been modified to prevent the possibility of replication further reducing the pos sibility of adverse effects 11 The vaccine being developed by the Jenner Institute also addressed the issue of preexisting immunity to the adenovirus by developing the vector in chimpanzees 8 12 Previous work on an adenoviral vector vaccine for Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS has shown that an adenoviral vector vaccine can produce a robust immune response to a coronavirus and aided researchers in developing an adenovirus viral vector vaccines for COVID 19 13 14 However trials 236 Chapter 21 Vaccines for COVID 19 SARS CoV 2

adenovirus based vaccine being developed by CanSino is currently in phase III of clinical trials Unfortunately current results from this vaccine show the rates of neutralizing antibody production were lower than desired and side effects reported were relatively high16 17 As of September 25 2020 the WHO has reported 45 vaccine candidates using adenovirus technology of which the most advanced and 237 promising candidates are from the Oxford University AstraZeneca and BioNTech Pfizer 8 21 4 2 RNA Vaccines RNA vaccines seek to induce the expression of a desired antigen in the patient by transporting genetic material into recipient s cells 18 Moderna s RNA vaccine an initial forerunner has begun its phase III trials and is expected to enroll 30 000 healthy participants who will receive two intramuscular injections spaced 28 days apart containing 100 microgram injections of mRNA 1273 or a saline pla cebo 19 The company has stated that the vaccine may not be available till 2021 20 Pfizer s vaccine another RNA vaccine may also have results early enough for approval in the fall 21 Both of these vaccines are using lipid nanoparticles to trans port RNA for translation and production of the antigen 22 23 By using lipid nanoparticles issues of degradation which have been associated with RNA vac cines can be reduced while serving as a method of delivery 22 Research also sug gests that RNA vaccines may elicit humoral and cell mediated immunity in a single dose 24 As of September 25 2020 the WHO has reported 24 vaccine candi dates using RNA technology 8 21 4 3 DNA Vaccines DNA can also be used to express the antigen in patients and like RNA vaccines can illicit a humoral and cell mediated immune response 25 There are 16 DNA vaccine candidates as of September 25 2020 four of these candidates are in phase II trials 8 However DNA vaccines have been reported of having lower immunoge nicity and different delivery techniques were explored in response to this phe nomenon 26 One of the major delivery techniques developed is electroporation the technique being used by Inovio pharmaceutical s vaccine candidate 25 Electroporation works by creating electrically induced pores to facilitate the entry of the DNA vaccine into the cell 26 Like adenoviral vector vaccines concerns of integration seem to be insignificant 27 Another method to address this issue is the addition of adjuvants substances that increase vaccine s immunogenicity to some DNA vaccine candidates 27 21 4 4 Live Attenuated Vaccines A live attenuated vaccine is a vaccine that takes a weakened form of the virus to illicit future immunity 28 Since this kind of vaccine emulates a real infection an antibody and cell mediated response that is long lasting may occur 28 29 This response can usually be achieved in one or two doses 30 However since live 238 Chapter 21 Vaccines for COVID 19 SARS CoV 2 Vaccines in Development and WHO Database attenuated vaccines emulate a real infection and because there is a small chance a live attenuated vaccine may return to a more pathological form certain individuals may not be suitable for receiving this form of vaccine 28 Although there are no live attenuated vaccines in the clinical stage there are three in development as of September 25 2020 8 21 4 5 Inactivated Vaccines Inactivated vaccines are vaccines that inject viruses inoculated by using heat chem icals or radiation 29 These vaccines cannot cause infections and can be safely administered to those who are immunocompromised 29 Some inactivated vaccines may also be stored at room temperature which may provide logistical benefits 30 Unfortunately inactivated vaccines do not create a cell mediated response and may also require booster doses 28 To get a desired immune response multiple doses are also usually required 28 As of September 25 2020 there are currently 14 inactivated vaccine candidates 5 of which are in clinical trials including three that are in phase III being developed by Chinese companies 8 Adjuvants are also being added to some of these vaccine candidates which may lead to dose sparing and therefore more available vaccines 8 27 21 4 6 Subunit Vaccines and Viral Like Particle Vaccines Another type of vaccine candidate type are subunit vaccines 8 Some of which are using adjuvants substances that increase an antigen s immunogenicity which could allow for more available doses 31 An inactivated vaccine uses the inoculated form of the pathogen while a subunit vaccine utilizes a specific portion of the pathogen 32 Since these vaccines also do not mimic an infection like an inactivated vaccine the immune response is mainly humoral and not cell mediated 32 This inability to cause an infection also makes these vaccines safer for the immunocompromised or those with certain health conditions but it is important to note that the vaccine s effective ness may be reduced in certain immunocompromised inidviduals 3 33 However these vaccines usually require multiple doses and or booster doses to produce suf ficient long term immunity 29 There are currently 70 subunit vaccine candidates defined by the WHO 13 of which are in clinical trials as of September 25 2020 8 A more specific type of subunit vaccine is a viral like particle VLP vaccine and there are 16 VLP vaccine candidates as of September 25 2020 one of which is in phase II clinical trials while another is in phase I 8 34 A VLP vaccine is con structed utilizing recombinant proteins to create particles that closely resemble the virus 35 The size and high repetitive structure may lead to high immunogenicity without risk to the immunocompromised due to the lack of genetic material in VLP vaccines 36 The nature of VLP vaccine production may provide advantages in increasing production 37 239 21 5 Who will Get the First Vaccines Chinese and Russian governments have approved adenovirus based vaccines for limited use without conclusive phase III studies which have raised a concern in the scientific community 38 Despite initial estimates of a vaccine being available by the end of 2020 experts and company statements are now estimating a vaccine some times next year 39 40 Multiple companies have already been investing into vaccine production but fears that supply will be limited exist 41 Therefore vulnerable populations may receive the first doses including children the elderly the immunocompromised patients with certain preexisting conditions and health care workers 42 Yet this may also be dependent on the vaccine as there are some reports that suggest that certain vaccines may not be suitable for some of these populations 43 21 6 Will these Vaccines Protect against a Mutated SARS CoV 2 Virus Whether or not the vaccines in development will prevent mutated forms of the virus remains unclear 44 The SARS CoV 2 virus is mutating as expected and some muta tions seem to have affected the spike protein the molecular target of many vaccine candidates 45 In order to prevent future strains from evading vaccines there have been recommendations for future drugs and vaccines to target areas of the viral genome that are relatively constrained 46 The rate of mutation however seems to be slower than that of influenza about half as slow 47 48 Another indicator that muta tions may not prevent the efficacy of vaccines is that vaccines can be designed to target multiple sites of the virus reducing the risk of a mutated virus escaping exist ing immunity 49 50 21 7 Will These Vaccines Produce Long Term Immunity There are multiple studies that suggest effective antibody levels may decline within a few months of SARS CoV 2 infection 51 52 This may be an issue in vac cines that produce primarily an antibody response and may only confer short term immunity However this drop in antibody levels does imply the absence of memory B cells which may allow the rapid production of antibodies if reinfec tion occurs 51 53 These studies may also further reinforce the importance of T cells and vac cines that illicit a cellular mediated response 52 T cells can also remember patho gens for many years and once reinfection occurs they can activate the immune system and kill any cells infected with the virus 54 Fortunately the detection of T cells that can recognize SARS CoV 2 in people once infected and those that received certain vaccine candidates suggest that long term immunity can be achieved 55 240 Chapter 21 Vaccines for COVID 19 References 21 8 Antivaxxers and Vaccine Efficacy Antivaccination sentiments have been increasing and may affect the rates of vacci nations for SARS CoV 2 56 Recent polls seem to show that only half of the US population may be willing to receive a vaccine for COVID 19 which is much lower than some estimates for achieving herd immunity a phenomenon that can protect unvaccinated individuals if enough of the population become immunized 56 58 Populations that are most hesitant may be those with historic mistrust of govern mental agencies such as African Americans due to the Tuskegee Study where members of the African American community were knowingly given syphilis and denied treatment 56 57 Widespread hesitation can also be accounted for by other fac tors like the speed of vaccine development and misinformation 56 Experts have expressed concerns how the existence of a vaccine may not stop the COVID 19 pandemic unless public opinion changes 59 John Hopkins Center for Health Security has published a report of strategies and guidance to increase the willingness for receiving a coronavirus vaccine https www centerforhealthsecurity org our work pubs archive pubs pdfs 2020 200709 The Publics Role in COVID 19 Vac cination pdf References 1 Arvin AM Greenberg HB New

Social determinants of health 22 1 Introduction Coronavirus disease COVID 19 has been termed the great equalizer capa ble of sickening anyone but the reality is that it has increasingly demonstrated that social inequalities in health are profound 1 In times of pandemics and epi demics such differences become even more exaggerated COVID 19 is not an equal opportunity killer and its victims are often the poor and economically vulnerable living in crowded conditions including prisons and those without access to health care These conditions in which people are born grow live work and age are known as the social determinants of health SDoH The SDoH are conditions They are shaped by the distribution of money power and resources and are mostly responsible for health inequities in the health status of people seen within and between countries 2 This chapter examines the SDoH of COVID 19 in the United States and touches upon some critical issues in devel oping societies 22 2 Social Determinants of Health Framework The SDoH framework includes five key areas of determinants economic stability education social and community context health and health care and neighborhood and built environment3 that affect peoples well being functioning and quality of life outcomes and risks Figure 22 1 Each of these five determinant areas includes a number of subtopics that inform the overall framework Table 22 1 For example 245 Figure 22 1 The social determinants of health Neighborhood and Built Environment Economic Stability Health and Health Care SDOH Education Social and Community Context Table 22 1 SDoH Elaborated Economic Stability Employment Income Expenses Debt Support Neighborhood and Physical Environment Housing Transportation Safety Parks Playgrounds Walkability Zip code geography Education Food Community and Social Context Health Care System Hunger Access to healthy options Social integration Social systems Community engagement Discrimination Stress Literacy Language Early education Vocational training Higher education Health coverage Provider availability accessibility Linguistic competence Quality of care Health Outcomes Mortality Morbidity Health Status under economic stability subtopics such as employment food insecurity housing instability and poverty would be included and social and community context would include civic participation discrimination incarceration and social cohesion In addition SDoH also include access to green spaces exposure to environmental tox ins and discrimination based on gender race or ethnicity immigration status and religion among others Unequal distributions and access to resources exposure to discrimination and administrative failures to ensure safety and maintenance all lead to the creation of 246 Chapter 22 Socioeconomic Racial and Cultural Considerations Race and COVID 19 phenomena called health disparities that is difference in outcomes as a result of economic social or environmental disadvantages 4 These are not singular or indi vidual acts of injustice but rather systemic and structural failures in the system and deliberate flaws in the infrastructure of society In contrast health equity aims to create situations that would avoid bad health outcomes for people through access to opportunities and resources and instituting certain protections that would reduce the burden of disease on disadvantaged groups The COVID 19 crisis has revealed that not all care is delivered equally and there are gaps in health care and health disparities which have grown wider as a result of the neoliberal policies and austerity measures There are communities that are dis proportionately affected by COVID 19 22 3 Race and COVID 19 Racial bias in the age of COVID 19 has occurred in two forms First the United States and other pro nationalistic governments politically stoked bias against people of Asian origins Second the virus amplified the structural inequalities and racial bias against Black Americans and other racial minorities in the United States The virus was scientifically named SARS CoV 2 based on its similar structure to SARS CoV Although the virus could have popped up anywhere where the envi ronment was conducive to interspecies transfer SARS CoV 2 originated in Wuhan China The US President Trump repeatedly referred to it as the Chinese virus or Wuhan virus 5 This deliberate labeling was politically motivated to single out and blame the Chinese government and shield the Administration its inadequate response and instead it led to acts of aggression and even physical violence against people of Asian descent In the eyes of the public there was a strong asso ciation between the virus and East Asians Cities like New York Los Angeles and rural states like Indiana have all reported incidents of discrimination and outright attacks on Asians due to the perception that they were directly responsible for the virus 6 The singling out of Asians was not limited to America but a global phenom enon 7 Increases in racist rhetoric coincided with racially motivated attacks on East Asians in Europe Africa and Latin America and against migrant workers in the Middle East and parts of Asia like Malaysia Second racial bias in the United States is deeply seeded and plays out in terms of worse health outcomes for Black communities 8 The situation with COVID 19 is no different COVID 19 data collected at the national level from counties showed that the disease was more prevalent and deadly among Black and Hispanic com munities Even though Black Americans accounted for 22 of the United States they had 52 of reported cases and 58 of deaths nationally 9 A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC found that after adjusting for age indigenous Native Americans and Blacks had a hospitalization rate five times that of white person and Hispanic or Latino person four times and attributed these differences to long standing systemic health and social inequities 10 The New York City Health Department created a report on infection and fatalities Among Black 247 Americans the death rate was 92 3 deaths per 100 000 Latin Americans had a death rate of 74 3 white Americans had a death rate of 45 2 and Asian Americans had a death rate of 34 5 in the lowest category Viruses do not discriminate on the basis of skin color so why in the United States is there such disparity in mortality rates The answer to this simple question is com plex and wrapped in layers of structural inequities and health disparities The SDoH affects health outcomes The living conditions for disadvantaged groups are but one reason America has had a long standing policy on residential segregation through redlining a systematic policy put in place by city planners that made higher valued properties inaccessible to underprivileged groups either through high pricing or through outright refusal to sell to Black Americans and Hispanic people The afford able housing available to Black communities was often poorly built and maintained crowded and cramped and included several generations sharing the same housing unit factors that contributed to poor health outcomes 11 13 Living under such conditions makes it difficult for people to follow the rule of physical distancing recommended by CDC for COVID 19 With no green spaces and cramped quarters with many people living in high rises the risk of exposure to COVID 19 increases and especially vulnerable are the elderly family members and those with underlying conditions At the same time Blacks and Hispanics face dis proportionately high risk because they are more likely to work in essential low paying jobs Under the pandemic people fulfilling such jobs have been designated as essential workers and face high risk of disease exposure through their employ ment 14 15 On the flip side racial minorities often do not have jobs that provide benefits such as paid parental leave sick leave or leave to care for elderly or ill family mem bers Black Americans and Hispanics are 7 13 less likely than their white coun terparts to have access to these benefits 16 Racial minorities have typically faced significantly diminished access to paid parental leave paid sick leave and paid leave to care for sick family members Compared to white individuals African Americans faced diminished access to any of these accommodations by up to 7 across three models of calculation with Hispanic individuals facing up to 13 These disparities are long standing and exist despite controlling for education and employment Since health insurance in America is tied to employment Black Americans and Hispanics usually have lower rates of health insurance and encounter difficulties in co payments even with access through Medicaid 17 In general Black and Hispanic communities face discrimina tion in access health services which are only magnified by the COVID 19 pandemic Unequal treatment of patients based on their race or ethnicity is well documented among health care workers In 2015 a study in Patient Education and Counseling found that patients from disadvantaged racial or ethnic backgrounds received less information from their doctors about treatment recommendations 18 Princeton University found that white medical students and residents can hold onto false beliefs about biological difference between black and white patients in doing so incorrectly report lower pain ratings for black patients In simpler terms students 248 Chapter 22 Socioeconomic Racial and Cultural Considerations Caste and COVID 19 in India and doctors with prejudices are less likely to believe black patients when they say they are in pain and it affected their treatment recommendations negatively 19 Bias like this has affected many medical fields One of the most popular topics in public health today is the racial difference in maternal mortality Black women are far more likely than their white counterparts to have negative outcomes including death during pregnancy Racism in health care was specifically emphasized as a contributing factor 20 In general these types of actions and reactions can be classi fied under the umbrella term implicit bias This refers to the prejudices and stereo types that dictate an individual s actions without explicit intention to do so And it did not stop when the pandemic hit A biotech data company Rubix Life Sciences based in Boston Massachusetts reviewed recent billing information in several states and found that African Americans with symptoms like cough and fever were less likely to be given a test for the coronavirus 21 Testing sites in historically black institutions also experienced greater delay in acquiring necessary testing equipment and protective gear A heat map of Memphis of where coronavirus testing is taking place revealed that most screening was happening in predominantly white and well off suburbs and not the majority Black lower income neighborhoods 15 21 Disadvantaged racial groups are highly more likely to have comorbidities for coronavirus like hypertension diabe tes HIV AIDS etc Diagnosis is the first step in receiving appropriate care for these patients Identifying positive cases can encourage people to self isolate and adhere to social distancing keeping them from spreading the diseases if they end up being sent home Delaying testing can allow for symptoms to worsen and result in hospitaliza tion or even death which could have been avoided 22 4 Caste and COVID 19 in India COVID 19 has created an unforeseen resurgence of caste based discrimination with fundamentalist using social distancing to re enforce the idea of untouchables in Hinduism The Hindu caste system India and the current Bharatiya Janata Party BJP government steeped in religious ideology has long ensured social segregation based on one s place in the hierarchy composed of four main groups Brahmins Kshatriyas Vaishyas and the Shudras and the last group of Dalits or untouchables that number around 200 million This group takes on the most menial and low paying jobs and for a variety of reasons poverty being chief among them are vul nerable to most diseases 22 In 2007 the Global institute of Public Health and the Santhigiri Research Foundation found that women from the lower cast have greater likelihood of ane mia higher neonatal and infant mortality rates and their children have a 30 higher likelihood of dying before their fifth birthday and only one in two have access to vaccinations 23 24 Another study reported that waiting time when visiting private doctors increased for those from lower social caste 25 COVID 19 has resulted in social exclusion of Dalits from accessing government benefits or humanitarian aid 249 and at the same time made them vulnerable to exposure given that they work essen tial jobs such as waste pickers and sanitation workers Since Dalits do not have the required government ID cards they are unable to access any government benefits such as subsidies to food access to public health care services or any other form of social protection They were particularly affected by Prime Minister Modi s order of a nationwide lockdown on March 23 that gave only four hours warning for these largely casual migrant labors to pack up and leave urban centers 26 Caste based discrimination creates barriers to health services and increases risk of exposure morbidity and mortality 22 5 Incarceration and COVID 19 America is known to have the largest prison population in the world a problem called mass incarceration referring not only to the total number of people in prison but also to the rate of imprisonment Since 1970 the number of incarcerated people far outpaces population growth and crime increasing 500 to 2 1 2 2 million peo ple in jail and prisons today 655 incarcerated people per 100 000 people 27 28 The increase in incarceration is a result of changes in laws and policies such as the three strikes law which automatically gives a person 25 years in prison for a third felony and prisoners who have been sentenced to life without parole 29 30 Today one in nine people in prison are serving a life sentence of which a third are sentenced to life without parole Race plays an important role in incarceration and research shows that Black citizens are six times more likely than white people to be incarcerated and almost three times more likely than their Latino counter parts who in turn are two times more likely to be incarcerated than white men 31 According to a report by the Department of Justice the population of prisoners aged 55 and older increased by 400 between 1993 and 2003 in part to longer sentences and in general an increase of admissions of older persons Mass incarceration has set up a perfect storm for a public health disaster such as COVID 19 in prisons There are thousands of people kept in poorly ventilated con fined space in close proximity with others and living conditions that create extreme stress on the body and mind Despite being a closed facility there is ample opportu nity for exposure with prison staff entering and exiting daily prisoners being trans ferred between facilities and prisoners have little ability to maintain social distancing or safe hygienic practices A federal prison in central Florida in February 2020 experienced an outbreak of Legionnaire s disease 32 Ross Macdonald of the Riker s Island jail system described the happening as a public health disaster unfolding before our eyes to the Guardian while reporting on 200 COVID 19 cases in 12 days in April 33 By June 6 there were 42 107 cases of COVID 19 and 510 deaths among 1 295 285 prisoners with a case rate of 3 251 per 100 000 prisoners 34 The COVID 19 case rate for prisoners was 5 5 times higher than the US population case rate a truly sobering statistic 35 Women and minorities face particularly high risk since both groups have higher rates of chronic diseases Correctional staff and their 250 Chapter 22 Socioeconomic Racial and Cultural Considerations Immigrants and COVID 19 families also share the high risks as they share the same environment and physical space COVID 19 transmission is unlikely to be contained in US prisons without implementation of more effective policies that acknowledge responsibility test iso late and treat infected prisoners and their contacts employ compassionate release for elderly and infirm prisoners improve sanitation and provide personal protective equipment and implement physical distancing 22 6 Immigrants and COVID 19 In the middle of April the US government made significant changes to the immigra tions system including postponing immigration hearings pausing deportation flight suspending refugee admissions and moving forward to blocking entry for asylum seekers and at the same time expelling anyone encountered at the border 36 These measures were taken to protect the American economy from the impact of foreign workers on US labor market but they also brought into sharp focus the intersection of immigration issues and public health policy According to data from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE Service as of July 1 more than 3 000 detainees have tested positive for COVID 19 that is 25 of all detainees tested 11 828 or 13 of all detainees 37 The largest number of positive cases 250 is from the Eloy Federal Contract Facility in Phoenix Arizona People living in detention centers face conditions similar to those in pris ons and cannot socially distance and have a limited access to soap 38 They are also subject to deportation even though this can spread the virus Those who are not under detention but undocumented often working in occupations such as agricul ture or large meatpacking plants are afraid to seek care when they are sick Immigrants have been disproportionately affected by COVID 19 Much of this information for medical care professionals is important with regard to understanding the pressures certain groups may be facing during clinical appoint ments That is to say keep in mind many patients may only be going to the doctor at the last possible moment because of financial needs or fears of how it may affect their immigration status Furthermore treatment plans should incorporate the likeli hood of patients being able to return for an appointment or afford one Another aspect is helping patients who are symptomatic or will understand the importance of isolating within the home especially since it is known that people of color and immigrant groups tend to live with extended family Some groups may have cultural healing practices or rely on religious prayer for healing which may either expose them to more people or expose them to risk factors that worsen illnesses Understanding the facts about different groups and cultures is what is known as cultural competence 39 While cultural competency is extremely important in setting patient care and understanding their risk factors with regard to infectious disease this understanding is only halfway to what is required for highly sensitive patient groups Medical care professionals risk losing patient contact when they fail to employ cultural humil ity 39 This aspect takes competence one step further and acknowledges one s own 251 culture and the moral equivalence of that culture to another This is a lifelong learn ing responsibility for anyone working with a variety of people like health care workers 22 7 Economic Inequalities and COVID 19 The COVID 19 pandemic has highlighted the harsh reality of economic inequality within and between countries Within countries the chronic gap in wealth and employment surfaced as an acute problem Those with financially secure jobs and savings were able to work from home and maintain social distancing compared with people who were living paycheck to paycheck or on daily wages through the infor mal sector found it difficult to pay rents and buy food 40 People with money were able to create the physical distance between themselves and others connect to oth ers via Zoom able to get food and other supplies delivered to their doors and hoard necessities But those without such affluence risked exposure through their jobs or lost their jobs altogether The unemployment rate was higher for Black workers 17 8 lost their jobs between February and April compared with 15 5 of white workers with black women facing the largest losses of 18 8 41 This scenario has played out in different parts of America prompting the US Congress to call for federally assisted income replacement the Coronavirus AID Relief and Economic Security CARES ACT which provides 1200 per adult for individuals whose income was less than 99 000 or up to 3 400 for a family of four with children under 17 years old 42 A total of 293 4 billion to people who had filed taxes but at the same time the CARES Act handed out an almost equal amount 257 9 billion in 2020 in tax breaks and corporate losses to the country s wealthiest people and corporations 43 The underlying inequalities continue to persist and result in poorer health outcomes for the less affluent 44 The World Bank estimates that COVID 19 will push 71 million into extreme poverty of 1 90 per day of earning 45 Sub Saharan Africa and South Asia will be hit hardest and see large increases in the number of poor Equally concerning are the marginally poor who earn less than 3 20 per day and their numbers will increase to 176 million The COVID 19 pandemic has laid bare the structural inequalities inadequate health care and the lack of social protections for the poor and exposed the social agenda that redefines the public good as helping the rich get richer 46 The pro growth policies focused on GDP have pushed aside the growing inequality rising hunger unaffordable health and housing costs dismantled social safety nets and promoted jobs that do not pay a living wage According to Philip Alston United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights the coronavirus pandemic has only helped to lift the veil of a preexisting pandemic of poverty and inequality and a political system that is designed by those in power to sustain and create wealth for themselves through an agenda of deregulation privatization and lower taxes for corporations and the wealth The dismantling of social safety nets and ecological devastation directly related to neoliberal policies will most likely create more threats to peoples health and well being 252 Chapter 22 Socioeconomic Racial and Cultural Considerations References 22 8 Conclusion COVID 19 has exacerbated the social determinants of health in the United States and around the world by creating job losses food insecurity housing instability and unequal health care for communities of color indigenous peoples prisoners immi grants and other marginal and disenfranchised groups Given the fragility of their lives they have not been able to exercise the self distancing and isolation required to prevent transmission In the United States Black communities have been dispro portionately hit but the reality is that all over the world those with limited resources and zero social safety have faced and continue to experience the brunt of COVID 19

philanthropist Bill Gates has referred to coronavirus disease COVID 19 as a once in a century pathogen that requires global cooperation for its containment 1 With no availability of vaccines or widespread immunity among people only public health measures can reduce transmission and control outbreaks Soon after the confirmation of human to human transmission of SARS CoV 2 the Chinese authorities imposed a cordon sanitaire a defined quarantine area from which those inside were not allowed to leave around Wuhan and then Hubei prov ince In addition the authorities ordered bans on public gatherings compulsory stay at home policies mandatory closures of schools and nonessential businesses and face mask ordinances among others 2 Other neighboring countries had already imposed some of these measures along with testing isolating positive cases contact tracing and quarantining those who had been exposed Nevertheless from the time that the first case of COVID 19 was identified on December 8 2019 to the time that the Chinese central government took full control of the outbreak a total of 47 days had passed and the virus had spread far and wide both within China and across the globe Multiple studies modeling the epidemic pre dicted that large overseas cities with transport links to China would become outbreak epicenters unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels were implemented This chapter looks at the global spread of COVID 19 and the responses imple mented by countries to control the pandemic Although the world is still in the midst 257 of the COVID 19 pandemic looking back over the early responses can provide insightful lessons about policy considerations even as cases decline or disappear in some countries or increase and resurge in others 23 2 East and Southeast Asian Response The Chinese Center for Disease Control CDC informed the local offices of the World Health Organization on December 31 2019 about pneumonia of unknown etiology But since mid December the information had been percolating on Chinese social media3 and Canadian based disease tracking company Blue Dot had revealed news of the outbreak 4 Neighboring Taiwan 81 miles off the coast of mainland China once learning of the official declaration started to screen incoming passengers from Wuhan 5 The Taiwanese government activated the Central Epidemic Command Center CECC that had been established in 2004 after the SARS epidemic The CECC coordinated efforts by various ministries and managed the response to the entire crisis Since the outbreak occurred just before the Chinese Lunar New Year a time dur ing which millions of Chinese and Taiwanese travel for the holiday the expectation was for Taiwan to have the second highest number of cases However the govern ment s quick response with real time alerts to classify travelers infectious risks based on flight origin and travel history and case identification and isolation quar antining of high risk individuals and regulating the pricing and availability of masks as well as fighting misinformation minimized the number of cases 6 Taiwan announced its first confirmed imported cases of COVID 19 on January 21 2020 7 By then it made use of its established national disease surveillance and reporting system as well as new location based monitoring programs via cell phone geolocation 8 The government also utilized a location tracking phone based appli cation to monitor compliance with quarantine measures Taiwanese citizens unique health ID cards enabled doctors and hospitals to access online records allowing for easier access to records of individuals with COVID 19 9 The hospitals prepared for surges and the production of personal protective equipment was scaled up and face masks were made widely available to the public All these measures meant that Taiwan a country of 23 million citizens could rely on less aggressive measures such as lockdowns and could allow the most economic activity to continue It has reported only 480 cases and 7 deaths until today August 10 2020 10 Other countries in the region that had experienced the SARS outbreak of 2002 and 2003 rushed to implement nonpharmaceutical measures and active screening and quarantining of individuals entering from Wuhan South Korea reported its first confirmed case of COVID 19 on January 20th the same time as the first reported case from the United States It had imposed screening measures on January 3 for individuals entering from Wuhan 11 yet cases began to slowly rise over the coming months On February 17 there were only 30 reported cases but over the next 10 days the cases grew exponentially and by the end of February there were nearly 3 000 COVID 19 cases in South Korea 12 The South Koreans learning from their criticized MERS response in 2015 clus ter outbreak of 186 cases and 38 deaths due to five superspreaders 13 acted quickly 258 Chapter 23 Health Care Policy and COVID 19 East and Southeast Asian Response to slow down transmission by expanding testing The government in partnership with the private sector built hundreds of high capacity screening clinics and 600 testing centers with testing capacity reaching 15 000 to 20 000 tests per day The nation of 51 million people also took a big data approach with contact mapping through credit card history and location from cell phone carriers The authorities also pushed an intense and mostly voluntary social distancing campaign but left most restaurants stores and social venues open for operation The Korean strategy included snuffing out clusters of disease outbreak through aggressive contact tracing and testing housing positive cases in temporary isolation wards separate from hospitals monitoring their symptoms regularly through smartphone applications or by phone and providing timely and accurate informa tion to the public and health care professionals about COVID 19 14 Experience with past outbreaks provided that people wore masks and stayed at home without requir ing government mandates By the end of March the pandemic was under control with fewer than 100 new cases per day and a total of 128 deaths An outbreak con nected to several nightclubs on May 12 was quickly brought under control To date October 3 2020 South Korea reported 24 239 cases and 422 deaths compared to the United States with over 7 7 million cases and 215 278 deaths even though both countries reported their first case on the same day Post SARS other countries such as Thailand Singapore and Vietnam had also invested in their public health infrastructure Thailand reported one of the first cases outside China January 16 but its early adoption of facemasks combined with a robust health care system and enforced lockdown in March which was lifted in May has kept cases to a minimum 15 A popular tourist destination with millions of foreign visitors Thailand has recorded only 3 600 cases and 59 deaths October 3 2020 It has imposed a strict 14 day quarantine period for all visitors Other coun tries such as Cambodia and Laos in the Mekong River Basin also recorded few COVID 19 infections and deaths Myanmar however saw a spike in confirmed cases from 336 reported in mid July to 10 000 in September and over 20 000 as of October 3 2020 However deaths remain low at 471 Vietnam was especially proactive moving quickly to put into place screening and testing measures quarantine centers for passengers coming in on international flights initiating aggressive multilevel contact tracing and informing people about COVID 19 through creative means such as songs and performances 16 17 Similar to Korea the Vietnamese employed a cluster strategy of containing outbreaks and tracing contacts to the third degree index case to those close proximity to index and those in contact with the close contact and quarantining those that did not test positive for the virus in government run centers and requiring self isolation at home for 14 days The exten sive tracing was supplemented by possible commune level lockdowns and although Vietnam did eventually introduce a nationwide lockdown it was relatively short lived April 1 15 but extended to 21 days in 28 out of 63 provinces Although the first confirmed case of COVID 19 was reported on January 23 Vietnam contained community transmission and has thus far October 3 2020 reported a total of 1 098 cases and 35 deaths until today The majority of confirmed cases nearly two thirds have been imported from China Europe and the United States 15 259 Singapore appeared initially well prepared and established border screening and quarantine measures for all new arrivals 18 The contact tracing was an inten sive effort between multiple agencies that used activity mapping analytic tools and surveillance footage The Singaporean economy remained open and it seemed that the worst of the pandemic had been averted However in April an outbreak of COVID 19 took hold among the 300 000 foreign workers living in overcrowded dormitories The migrant workers were not allowed to leave and relied entirely on government support for food and water communications and entertainment The country went into a lockdown on April 7 for nearly 2 months but infection rates soared despite the high quality of health care 19 Although deaths 27 in total remained low the paradox of high rate of COVID 19 infections 55 353 positive cases to date highlights the vulnerabilities among migrant communities that have little control over their lives and living situation Singapore started a phased lift ing of restrictions on June 2 but remote working arrangements and keeping physi cal distance orders stay in effect Migrant workers continue to remain in lockdown The Japanese government was initially criticized for its management of COVID 19 because passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship floating off the coast of Yokohama city contributed to the initial but mild wave of community spread A larger surge occurred in late March and cases were managed through 460 local public health centers hokenjo in Japanese which doubled as miniature centers of disease control 20 The centers were strained and became bottlenecks for testing while designated hospitals brimmed with mild cases In mid April the government declared a national state of emergency and shifted to restructure the strained health care system into a more expansive network that included privately owned facilities and started to house mild and asymptomatic cases in converted hotels or ordered them to stay at home By May Japan had flattened the curve and averted a full blown health crisis compared to countries of similar demographics like Italy aging population and economic development like the United States 21 It had managed to bring down transmission without large scale testing or very restrictive social distancing by focusing on clusters of infection in gyms pubs live music venues karaoke rooms and similar types of establishments where people get together for extended periods of time Japanese citizens complied voluntarily to wear masks and avoid large gatherings The public health responses to COVID 19 by Indonesia and the Philippines floundered and were delayed Both countries continued to see new infections and deaths Indonesia reported a total of 128 776 cases an average of roughly 1500 new cases per day since mid June and 5765 deaths August 10 2020 22 Philippines surpassed Indonesia in terms of total cases 139 538 confirmed COVID 19 cases and 2312 deaths Over the past 2 weeks new cases continued to grow exponentially with a jump from around 1500 cases at end July to over 6000 on August 9 23 The pandemic has challenged the Philippines health care infrastructure and the country was included in the Global Humanitarian Response Plan together with 63 of the hardest hit countries in the South 24 260 Chapter 23 Health Care Policy and COVID 19 Europe 23 3 Europe On January 27 the WHO European Region and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control ECPD introduced a surveillance system and asked coun tries to report confirmed and probable cases of COVID 19 25 The overall strategic aim at the time was containment with a rapid identification of probable cases and contact tracing The first case detected in France on January 19 followed by two cases on January 24 had direct links to Wuhan 26 By February 21 47 cases of COVID 19 were reported from 9 countries that included Belgium 1 Finland 1 France 12 Germany 16 Italy 3 Russia 2 Spain 2 Sweden 1 and the United Kingdom UK 9 Researchers observed transmission of infection taking place in two broad contexts sporadic cases linked to travel from China and local community transmission in Europe 27 Clustered outbreaks occurred in France Spain 7 person cluster in Haute Savoie and cases were detected in UK and 14 cases from Bavaria Germany and the risk level of similar clusters and community transmis sion was raised from low to moderate and then high 28 Although the Germans initially experienced a high rate of infection they were able to slow down the transmission of the virus They had developed the first diag nostic test for COVID 1929 and started early testing for the virus increased the capacity of hospitals to manage severe cases and engaged in a transparent and sci entific communications strategy The German government at the federal and state levels undertook several measures such as social distancing banning gatherings wearing facemasks and stay at home orders in some states While these restrictive measures caused anger and frustration and even protests and were considered to impinge on basic rights they contained the spread of the virus By June the UK had over 300 000 cases over 100 000 more than Germany More striking was the differ ence in the total deaths 46 526 deaths in the UK in comparison to 9268 deaths in Germany An individual with COVID 19 was 6 5 times more likely to die in the UK than in Germany because of the delays in implementing public health policies The Germans were able to successfully handle the pandemic At the forefront of medicine with a strong pharmaceutical industry they had started early production of test kits and personal protective equipment PPE They introduced early lockdowns based on outbreaks and followed up on positive cases and their contacts As the country entered into a recession because of the lockdown the government intro duced an aid package of 808 billion to mitigate the damage which included sup port to further strengthen the health care system to provide help to small businesses and the self employed to provide state aid for companies and to secure corporate debt at risk of defaulting 30 A fresh domestic stimulus package worth 146 billion was launched in June for 2020 202131 that included providing families with an extra 336 per child In contrast COVID 19 caught the Italians wholly unprepared By mid February cases began to rapidly increase in northern regions of Italy and two deaths were recorded 32 Similar to Wuhan the Italian provinces in the northern region became the next epicenter and cases rose from 3 to 50 to 800 On March 8 the Italian govern ment closed public spaces and prohibited traveling to Lombardia Emilia Romagna 261 Piemonte and Veneto Commercial activities were closed aside from essential busi nesses A nationwide lockdown was declared on March 9 and all flights were sus pended But these measures were introduced too late as 14 other countries in Europe confirmed their first cases seeded from travelers who visited Italy By March 19 the death toll in Italy surpassed that of China s totaling 4 634 and it was eventually 7 5 times more 33 The health system was quickly saturated with cases and faced major shortages of intensive care unit ICU beds ventilators and personal protective equipment 34 The highly competent state run health care sys tem overwhelmed with cases especially as flu season was still ongoing experi enced overcrowding and disorder within and across hospitals resulting in high rates of transmission among medical personnel and patients At one point there were 900 deaths per day and the horror stories of doctors being forced to choose who to treat and dramatic scenes of people lying on hospital floors circulated around the world A total of 35 216 deaths occurred in Italy 87 in people over 70 years old 35 and over 150 medical doctors36 lost their lives The crude mortality rate in Italy was 6 7 The death rate was 58 3 per 100 000 population in Italy almost six times that of Germany at 11 08 per 100 000 population and 10 less than the UK at 69 81 per 100 000 population 37 The Italian government however did take several strategic steps to contain the unfolding crisis including social distancing mandatory face masks banning large gatherings closure of nonessential commercial and retail businesses and closure of schools and universities among others The Italian government also passed a 25 billion Euros financial package Cura Italia of which 3 2 billion was used for strengthening the health care infrastructure New hospitals were built and the existing buildings were converted to house infected cases By early April intensive care beds had doubled and the departments for infection and respiratory disease received an influx of funding to purchase PPE Community nurses were recruited to intensify testing and contact tracing Any indi vidual who tested positive or who had come in contact with a positive case was placed under self isolation and home quarantine of 14 days After nearly 70 days Italy loosened its restrictions on May 4 But the Italian government s decentralized approach and bureaucratic red tape proved to be challenging in containing the out break and minimizing the deaths Following the spike of cases in Italy Austria closed its border But soon it con firmed two cases tourists from Italy Like many other countries in Europe Austria did not shut down nonessential businesses until mid March and although it did not mandate wearing masks in public until April it managed to contain the outbreak by a rigorous and punitive social distancing regime that fined people for breaking quar antine The government set up a hotline to dispatch medical workers to test for COVID 19 at home and also implemented a random testing policy to find presymp tomatic and asymptomatic cases As a result there were only 22 439 infections and 724 deaths 38 The mortality rate was 8 16 per 100 000 population France like Germany has a strong central government and advanced health care system But its death rate was 4 5 times higher than that of Germany even though it confirmed its first case around the same time One reason for the difference was that the French government did not implement social distancing measures or ban large gatherings Until early March President Emmanuel Macron was still seen in large 262 Chapter 23 Health Care Policy and COVID 19 Europe gatherings shaking hands and kissing other colleagues and even making public appearances in retirement homes 39 The French did not impose a lockdown until March 17 and failed to build their logistical capacity to promote mass testing 40 Only 45 public laboratories were accredited and there was a limited availability of reagents for RT PCR testing Instead of scaling up testing authorities argued that systematic testing was not needed and only reversed their position in late March as a way to end the lockdown Although France had an expert committee for scientific guidance it proved ineffec tive in informing policy The French also faced shortages of PPE relying on China for both masks and testing kits The government introduced a series of laws to protect businesses including a 300 billion euros loan program that included the protection of workers It intro duced Operation Resilience that used the French military to provide medical and logistical help and created checkpoints to prevent people from defying lockdown order But while these policies appeared to be heading in the right direction the government decided to hold the first round of mayoral elections a decision forced by political opponents of President Macron who wanted to take advantage of his rising unpopularity However the President postponed the second round given the low voter turnout and the severe losses incurred by his political party 41 On June 2 the government fully relaxed the lockdown measure The French government maintaining a reputation of being colorblind refused to collect data by race and it failed to acknowledge the disproportionate effect the pandemic had on its minority communities 42 The politicization of COVID 19 crippled France s abil ity to manage the public health crisis Over 600 000 cases have been recorded in France and 32 299 deaths until October 3 2020 Greece has the second highest aging population in the European Union after Italy and with years of economic hardship and austerity it has a weak health care system However the Greek government reacted swiftly to the threat of COVID 19 adopting an approach driven by science Rather than promoting public messages that conflict with those of its own public health officials Prime Minister Mitsotakis consulted with specialists from the University of Athens Medical School the National Research and Technology Centre and other institutions and established a specialized task force that advised on policy and communicated with the public 43 The emphasis on transparency quelled any backlash against socially disruptive mea sures that were introduced by the government In addition the government through a public private partnership effectively managed its health resources doubling its ICU capacity by the end of March 44 It employed over 4000 new doctors and nurses and spent an estimated 5 billion per month 45 As a result of its proactive interven tions Greece experienced only 6177 cases and 216 deaths 46 It has opened up its economy and resumed tourism a major source of revenue Tourists entering Greece are tested for the virus and depending on their results they are either required to self isolate or spend 14 days in supervised quarantine 47 Sweden was an outlier in comparison to its neighboring countries and never imposed a full lockdown keeping businesses restaurants and most schools open throughout the pandemic It did not officially prescribe policies of social distancing and the use of facemasks Swedes naturally adopted preventative measures such as 263 keeping their distances limiting social interactions refraining from forming crowds and wearing masks The approach resulted in a high death toll nearly 6000 deaths or 567 deaths per million people compared to three times that of Denmark 166 deaths per million people and 7 times that of Finland 59 deaths per million people and Norway 47 deaths per million per million The COVID 19 deaths per million in Sweden were closer to Italy than to its neighbors 1 Sweden experienced an eco nomic recession 23 4 Oceania Australia and New Zealand Australia and New Zealand with two very different governments managed to success fully control the outbreak of SARS CoV 2 48 New Zealand reported its first case on February 26 and moved swiftly to shut down the country Initially it instigated shut ting its borders to other nations but a week later shut down all nonessential business and then went further implementing a level 4 lockdown meaning that people could interact only within their household unit The strategy was accompanied with text messages explaining what was expected from the individual and accompanied by Facebook Live videos of the country s prime minister explaining the situation As a result New Zealand reported just over 1500 cases and only 22 COVID 19 deaths The government of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern also introduced a series of tax reforms that supported small businesses and protected individuals from losing their homes In addition in a symbolic gesture Ardern and her ministers took a 20 cut in salaries The full lockdown allowed the government to get its systems up and running and to effectively manage testing and contact tracing as well as surveillance 49 The New Zealand response based on scientific evidence leadership and careful communica tion helped to slow down transmission and eliminate the virus 50 On June 8 the country announced that it was COVID 19 free but it remains vulnerable to future outbreaks Australian leadership could not be more different than New Zealand but it also managed to contain the COVID 19 outbreak by deferring to its scientists for guid ance As COVID 19 spread across the vast island federal and state leaders from across the political spectrum coordinated their response rooted in scientific evi dence As early as March Australia was possibly heading towards a public health disaster with cases rising exponentially and not enough testing 51 The passengers on the Ruby Princess cruise liner amounting to 700 COVID 19 positive cases 10 of total cases were allowed to disembark and self isolate despite exposure to COVID 19 The country also suffered from PPE shortages with many health professionals unable to get enough materials for self protection 52 But in the middle of March the Australian government turned the tide and estab lished a COVID 19 national cabinet to respond to the pandemic 53 All states and ter ritories met to agree and implement consistent policies on testing social gatherings visitor restrictions to long term facilities and quarantine period Listening to health experts guiding policy political leadership remained apolitical of the COVID 19 out break Social distancing rules were put in place and the government expanded access to telemedicine services to over 3 million patients 54 Changes in hospital services 264 Chapter 23 Health Care Policy and COVID 19 The Americas including screening staff patients and visitors as well as aggressive testing of those most at risk and effective communication prevented greater transmission 55 As of October 3 a total of 27 173 cases of COVID 19 have been recorded with 895 deaths 56 23 5 The Americas The only entry of a successful response in the Americas is Canada which had expe rienced a localized SARS breakout in 2003 with 44 deaths 56 This had pushed the government to invest in testing and surveillance infrastructure for any future pan demics but even then Canadians were initially unprepared They did not recom mend social distancing or ban of large gatherings facemasks and other interventions until the first COVID 19 death 57 Despite some delay in their response the Canadian government implemented social distancing and lockdowns Listening to the advice of health professionals cross partisan decisions and actions served to send a mes sage of unity to the general public and reduce transmission However Canada s public health system has three levels of jurisdiction fed eral provincial 10 provinces and regional 3 territories In a manner similar to the United States where individual states determine the response in Canada prov inces and territories have the authority to determine strategies for containment while the federal government focuses on international border closing managing PPE supplies testing kits and ventilators There was considerable cooperation between the federal and provincial governments including on policies related to social distancing banning public gatherings school and university closures and closing of public spaces and nonessential businesses 58 Long term care facilities for elderly struggled to contain the outbreak and 81 of deaths occurred in these facilities 59 Employees in elderly care worked in multiple facilities and were spreading the virus The Canadian military was deployed to sup port facilities and contain transmission Public health agencies hired extra people for testing and contact tracing and the government introduced a new COVID 19 exposure mobile app Masks were recommended in June and mandated in parts of Canada By August 12 2020 Canada reported a total of 120 844 cases and 9006 deaths Currently less than 300 new cases are being reported across the country unlike its neighbor the United States that has been recording over 50 000 new cases daily and 1 000 deaths 60 The US government response to the COVID 19 outbreak has been catastrophic and President Trump s administration has left policymaking for the outbreak up to state governors Often the federal government and some state governors have even downplayed the impact of the virus As a result the United States which makes up 4 of the global population has reported 26 of COVID 19 cases 5 4 million of the 20 8 million cases and the highest number of deaths at nearly 170 000 22 of total deaths followed by Brazil at 104 263 14 deaths and India at 47 138 6 deaths August 22 2020 61 However as numbers have gone up globally the United States proportion of cases has declined to 21 4 and deaths to 20 4 October 3 2020 The US government initially ignored any warnings regarding the virus even though the administration was made aware of the outbreak on January 3 62 The first 265 known case of COVID 19 was detected on January 19 a 35 year old man in Snohomish County Washington 63 By February there was evidence of person to person transmission 64 but the cases were downplayed and President Trump repeat edly ignored warnings instead stating that the virus would disappear 65 The CDC botched testing efforts further delaying the ability to detect new cases 66 State gov ernors failed to recognize the severity of the crisis despite ample warning signs from Europe and Asia Most officials delayed on providing transparent guidance based on scientific evidence and on introducing coherent public health policies of social dis tancing banning large gatherings wearing facemasks and closing of schools uni versities and nonessential business As the CDC advised and provided guidance to the Federal government and states on reducing transmission and flattening the curve the responses remained inconsistent 67 By the third week of March COVID 19 cases increased exponentially and cities such as New York and San Francisco scrambled to manage the outbreak The epi center of the pandemic had once again shifted from China to Italy and now the United States The pandemic exposed the fragility of some of the most marginalized American communities including racial and ethnic inequities and economic dis parities deeply rooted in decades of structural discrimination 68 Five former CDC directors noted that America was behind the curve in containing the virus despite its considerable resources scientific expertise and state of the art health infrastruc ture and furthermore simple behavioral interventions like wearing a mask had become far too politicized 69 70 In March 2020 one of the earliest estimates of the impact of COVID 19 from the IHME Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation projected a total of 81 114 deaths 95 UI 38 242 162 106 from COVID 19 over the next 4 months in the US 2 As a result of many of the policy failures noted above the number of deaths in the United States has already far exceeded this projection 170 000 on August 20 2020 IHME s latest August 7 2020 COVID 19 forecasts indicate that the US will reach nearly 300 000 deaths by December 1 2020 The IHME issued simple and stark guidance along with this latest estimate if mask wearing in public increases to 95 more than 66 000 lives could be saved 3 In Brazil President Bolsonaro s response was similar to the US s President Trump s 71 Even as cases rose the government postponed issuing recommendations of physical distancing wearing facemasks banning social gatherings closing schools and nonessential businesses as well as regional lockdowns and instead played down the virus comparing it to seasonal flu Many of these aforementioned public measures had been utilized in prior health emergencies such as H1N1 and the Zika virus but had fallen out of favor with the current administration s decentralized approach 72 President Bolsonaro s rigid insistence that the virus posed no danger and later his belief in using hydroxychloroquine unproven antimalarial drug as a remedy for COVID 19 resulted in the termination of his health minister and resignation of the second within a month of taking on the job 73 Testing remained low even as cases grew Similar to the United States where state governors and city mayors stepped in to mitigate the COVID 19 impact in Brazil the states and municipal govern ments stepped in to take up the mantle of responsibility 74 In low income 266 Chapter 23 Health Care Policy and COVID 19 Conclusion Lessons Learned neighborhoods known as favelas transmission and mortality rates were higher given that social distancing was a near impossible challenge 75 Indigenous people and people of color were most affected with rates of transmission three times greater in poor neighborhoods compared to wealthy areas 76 The first confirmed COVID 19 case was detected on February 26 and today August 13 Brazil has the second highest number of cases after the United States at 3 1 million and reported over 100 000 deaths Both countries were reporting an average of 55 000 new cases per day and over 1000 deaths per day 77 The Americas account for less than 10 of the global population but have recorded 30 of COVID 19 related deaths78 and 50 of cases 11 1 million 79 The Pan American Health Organization Director noted that the COVID 19 pandemic revealed not only the structural deficiencies in the health sector resulting from years of inadequate public investment but also the inequalities around livelihoods 80 Coupled with delayed initiatives poor leadership and misinformation campaigns that undermined the scientific realities it should not be a surprise that the COVID 19 pandemic continues to rage in the Americas with the one exception of Canada which manages to limit infections 81 23 6 Conclusion Lessons Learned While no government should be blamed for creating the COVID 19 pandemic they should be scrutinized for how they responded in slowing down transmission and protecting the health of their people including preventing excess mortality The pub lic health policies for containing the outbreak were the same but the timing of their implementation varied across the world Some countries imposed aggressive mea sures early on to contain and manage outbreaks and others reacted slowly The effect of travel restriction modestly slowed down viral transmission by 3 5 days in China after the Wuhan lockdown 82 But it had a marked effect at an international scale reducing case importation by nearly 80 until mid February The authors concluded that travel bans and restrictions were not as effective as early detection hand wash ing self isolation and quarantine measures in mitigating the COVID 19 pandemic While this chapter did not cover the situation in western Asia Middle East Africa and the Pacific the elements of a successful response with regard to infec tions and deaths are evident in these regions as well Listed below are the interven tions shown to limit infection in the absence of vaccines and effective treatment 1 Early implementation of nonpharmaceutical public health measures Given the airborne nature of COVID 19 transmission outbreaks could only be limited by implementing measures such as physical social distancing good hand hygiene and facemasks Banning large gatherings closing schools uni versities public playground and nonessential business and mandating stay at home orders substantially reduced contact between people and helped to bring down the rate of transmission Travel restrictions had a modest impact on reducing transmission especially when community spread had already started 267 2 Testing testing testing Isolating positive cases contact tracing and quarantining exposed individuals The importance of testing was central to containing COVID 19 especially clustered outbreaks that could turn into super spreading events Ongoing containment of viral transmission espe cially as the next flu season approaches and restrictions are lifted requires a robust testing strategy that includes positive individuals to self isolate and their contacts to quarantine A testing strategy should include both the RT PCR and serological tests for antigens and should focus on asymptom atic and presymptomatic carriers and priority populations such as the elderly health care workers immunocompromised individuals or those with chronic conditions Mass serological testing can also provide a preva lence estimate of COVID 19 in the population The Brookings Institute and Washington University in St Louis produced a computational simulation model to inform policy responses to COVID 19 called Testing Responses Through Agent Based Computation Epidemiology TRACE 82 for the United States 3 Scientifically accurate and transparent decision making and public com munications by leadership Countries that made decisions based on medical and scientific evidence and communicated the true facts to their citizens man aged to control the spread of the virus and minimize deaths Governments that denied viral spread or built mistrust of their public health and medical offi cials fared much worse resulting in greater confusion They experienced a higher number of cases and as a result many more deaths 4 Well resourced health infrastructure including plans for pandemics Countries that had experienced the SARS outbreak were better prepared including having a pandemic response plan coordinated across various gov ernment agencies They were able to mobilize quickly and contain the out break They had stockpiled PPE maintained their health infrastructure or in the case of China were able to quickly build as needed and maintained suf ficient investments in medical professionals and health care workers Governments who had been cutting health care and public services budgets did much worse including those who had decimated their public health sector 5 Prioritizing the most at risk which includes the poorest and most mar ginalized along with those who are vulnerable to the virus COVID 19 has brought out the stark inequalities embedded in today s globalized world People with higher incomes and stable jobs were able to follow the public health recommendations but those with lower incomes held essential jobs and were from ethnic and racial minorities They were unable to keep physical distance less informed about the pandemic and often had preexisting condi tions As a result they bore the brunt of exposure and mortality Governments that prioritized a holistic approach and provided income support along with health services were able to contain the virus much quicker than those where there was an absence of universal comprehensive health care protection against job loss and supplemental income 268 Chapter 23 Health Care Policy and COVID 19 References COVID 19 has infected over 21 million people and continues to rage in coun tries that never contained the virus and has resurged in some countries that ended community transmission because of international travel This coronavirus may never go away It is much more transmissible but not as deadly as its cousins SARS and MERS and outbreaks are going to continue to pop up Even if it was eliminated from circulation among humans the pathogen has successfully made the interspecies jump and could easily transmit back into humans from its animal host Governments around the world have learned that they need to recognize their role in supporting health care and public health infrastructure to put aside partisan differ ences in times of crisis in order not to sow confusion and distrust to take care of their most disadvantaged citizenry in order to protect them as well as the population at large and to heed the advice of experts and work in close collaboration with respective agencies in order to create coherence and

disease 24 1 Introduction Coronavirus disease COVID 19 pandemic has overwhelmed countries brought economies to a standstill and forced people to sequester in their homes With no vaccines or effective treatment available interventions have focused on nonpharma ceutical methods along with testing contact tracing and quarantining Some coun tries have managed to successfully control the initial unfolding of SARS CoV 2 transmission and developed strategies to mitigate the possibility of resurgence of infections Others are still in midst of the first wave of the pandemic COVID 19 is now part of diseases that infect people and this chapter looks at the potential future of our world with COVID 19 24 2 How Might the Pandemic End Theoretically there are three possible scenarios characterizing how the coronavirus pandemic might end one that is catastrophic one that is the best possible scenario and one that is in between the two 1 2 The first scenario is based on building up herd immunity by allowing the disease to run its course through the population This essentially means that few protective measures will be in place and most people will become infected Those who get infected and recover will begin to make up the immune population until hopefully eventually the virus will find no more viable hosts and fail to infect any more peo ple Herd immunity would only be possible if 70 90 3 of the population became permanently immune 4 This is the fastest way for the pandemic to come to a head and effectively eradicate the virus but of course would be unspeakably disastrous for the human population and health systems worldwide 11 Many people would die 275 The second scenario is based on cooperation among leaders to control the spread of the virus through precise and aggressive containment measures Comprehensive testing would be required in order to identify any and all cases which are then placed under immediate isolation Strong cooperation between leadership full com pliance of the public and adequate resources would be a prerequisite to enforcing this level of containment 1 This is an attractive strategy which could eventually shrink the magnitude of the coronavirus pandemic perhaps similar to the original SARS in 2003 Health policy expert Dr Harvey Fineberg predicted it may take as little as 10 weeks to crush the curve with a forceful enough campaign 5 However given the exponential upward trend of outbreaks in the United States as well as the political sociocultural and economic climates that the pandemic was born into this is astronomically unlikely to happen Finally the third route is a strategy of mitigation until a vaccine comes This is generally what is occurring around the world through various degrees of public health measures and the resulting daily number of cases The summer and remain ing months of 2020 are still described as part of the first wave in the United States 6 The disease will remain circulating as long as containment measures are imperfect and as long as it takes for a vaccine to be made and distributed While there are still too many unknowns to accurately make predictions the pat terns of other coronaviruses and past pandemics may be considered for thinking ahead Some researchers speculate transmission dynamics which depend on two unknown factors immunity status after infection and seasonality of infection 24 2 1 If Immunity is Permanent then Covid 19 is a Relatively Brief and Intense Pandemic Kissler et al 7 built a deterministic model of SARS CoV 2 transmission dynamics with a focus on the United States and cross immunity interactions between the 2019 virus and other coronaviruses 7 Their projections consistently determined that given permanent immunity to COVID 19 the virus would cause a major outbreak and then effectively disappear in 5 or more years 1 The WHO has found that most stud ies show that people generate antibodies to the virus after recovery However there is no evidence yet to determine whether or not antibodies to SARS CoV 2 confer immunity to future infections 8 24 2 2 If Immunity is Temporary and not Permanent then Covid 19 Enters Regular Circulation of Other Respiratory Infections In the case of temporary immunity multiple sources point to the scenario of an initial wave of SARS CoV 2 followed by the long term seasonal flares much like the flu 1 4 9 Kissler et al 7 modeled different durations of temporary immunity lead ing to possible annual biennial or sporadic outbreak patterns Based on other known coronaviruses a duration of immunity of 40 weeks leads to an annual 276 Chapter 24 Looking Beyond the COVID 19 Pandemic The Future of COVID 19 and Dealing with the Years Ahead pattern while a longer 2 year immunity leads to biennial outbreaks 10 Cross immunity with the existing coronaviruses also plays a role in the duration of immunity 11 A Swedish modeling study also simulated different scenarios using data from the existing endemic coronaviruses 12 Plausible model parameters show an initial phase in which northern and southern temperate and tropical regions see different patterns of circulation After a few years they predict SARS CoV 2 will become a seasonal coronavirus with characteristic winter outbreaks What determines seasonality Infectious disease experts and biologists say that even for well known diseases it s not exactly clear 11 Other researchers analyzed past pandemics since 1700 and did not discern any clear seasonal pattern for most The 1968 pandemic Hong Kong flu was the only one with seasonality characterized by more winter dominant out breaks Seven other pandemics in the past had an early peak which waned until a second peak erupted about 6 months after the first 13 Some Russian scientists generated similar predictions when thinking from a virus host perspective They speculate that the virus will eventually become sea sonal and endemic after a series of microevolutionary events during the initial wave They paint a picture that perhaps one wintertime day in the future a person will catch the virus visit their doctor who will prescribe something like covidol and recover in days 10 While it is not an impossible future only the virus and our collec tive actions will forecast how the pandemic will unfold 24 3 The Future of COVID 19 and Dealing with the Years Ahead 24 3 1 Ongoing Mitigation Every day of the pandemic we learn from the mistakes and discoveries of others It is vital that accurate information is shared widely in the public and in scientific communities Much information is already constantly promulgated by health experts public officials and news outlets Still it is worth reinforcing how mitiga tion strategies are actually proving to work due to persistent objections and politici zation of some of these measures Researchers and health officials acknowledge that an extended period of quar antine may not be realistic for many reasons Moreover a one time quarantine might merely delay an inevitable peak 7 14 15 Multiple sources conclude that a feasible strategy is intermittent social distancing as well as increasing critical care capacity 10 14 16 Decisions to increase or loosen distancing restrictions should be informed by ongoing and widespread testing contact tracing and other data collection A short term goal might be to balance economic activity without exceeding health care capacities 7 At the same time development of vac cines and other interventions is an urgent priority Research on serology would also be helpful to learn more about the long term immunology and transmission dynamics of the virus 277 For more information see the following sections Ch 21 21 3 Vaccines Vaccines in development for SARS CoV 2 Ch 18 2 Hospital Preparedness Ch 3 1 3 2 3 3 Transmission Prevention nonpharmaceutical interventions NPIs Ch 19 Diagnostics Testing The numbers evolve so rapidly so it is important to keep a pulse on the local situ ation by regular testing This might involve the implementation of systems in com munities to streamline testing and reopening and restriction of activities Without comprehensive testing a significant percentage of transmission may occur unknow ingly by asymptomatic individuals Importantly the use of cloth masks would help reduce asymptomatic transmission 17 18 Simple cloth masks with 30 efficacy compared to 70 efficacy of medical grade masks have been proven to reduce the risk of infection and transmission of the virus 19 Other preventative measures see Chapter 3 should also be adopted A study published in March 2020 revealed early transmission in China 18 Researchers used a very large pool of mobility data to build a dynamic networked population model and subsequently made inferences about epidemiology of SARS CoV 2 It was found that undocumented infections were the source of 79 of docu mented infections Another modeling study used highly detailed mobility data to describe transmission dynamics in the Boston metropolitan area 16 Aleta et al 16 sought to calculate what percentage of the population would need to be quarantined in order to follow a proposed contact tracing and isolation strategy If 50 of symp tomatic infections were identified and 40 of their contacts were traced then about 9 of the population would need to be quarantined at any given time Researchers at Emory University generated a similar model with partial restoration of the econ omy based on testing 20 This group investigated the role of serological testing in allowing seropositive individuals to be free of social distancing and act as immu nological shields To be clear these models were generated with limitations and imperfect param eters thus further confirmation is needed However the idea of selective quaran tine alongside a semi active economy may be worth exploring for a sustainable future 24 3 2 Dealing with the Aftermath This section addresses the period not only after the peak has passed but in the event of successful eradication of the disease The WHO has recommended actions to take on a national level in order to address the long term health and social impact of a pandemic These actions are multifaceted and subdivided into categories 278 Chapter 24 Looking Beyond the COVID 19 Pandemic Conclusion 1 Planning and coordination review lessons learned with the international community replenish resources 2 3 4 5 Situation monitoring and assessment evaluate the pandemic characteris tics and situation monitoring and assessment tools for the next pandemic and other public health emergencies Reducing the spread of disease conduct a thorough evaluation of all inter ventions implemented Continuity of health care provision evaluate the response of the health system to the pandemic and share the lessons learned Communications publicly acknowledge contributions of all communities and sectors and communicate the lessons learned incorporate lessons learned into communications activities and planning for the next major pub lic health crisis Even without a vaccine significant changes in individual behaviors such as hand washing and masks wearing and public policies can reduce disease transmission Preventable diseases already cause huge losses of life For example on average 400 000 people die each year from malaria 1 5 million die from tuberculosis and 140 000 children die from measles for which there is a vaccine Since the virus selectively impacts the elderly and those with underlying chronic diseases it is pos sible that with smart interventions deaths in these groups can be averted in the future COVID 19 unleashed an unprecedented and rarely witnessed rush of pub lications to mitigate its impact share information on treatments and find vaccines In the midst of a lot of uncertainty there is a lot that has been discovered and shared about COVID 19 As the pandemic evolves this section and book will continue to evolve with it 24 4 Conclusion The COVID 19 pandemic has had devastating effects on people and economies As of August 27 over 800 000 people had died The economic effects to the world economies have also been devastating It has resulted in one of the largest global recession in history with much of the world being locked down in quarantine It is expected that global contraction could reach greater than 2 in 2020 Although governments have recorded one of the largest financial fiscal packages in recorded history which to date is already greater than 9 trillion the impact of loss of jobs livelihoods and homes will have far reaching consequences including depression The coronavirus pandemic is also upending the US Presidential elections with conventions being held virtually to a significant amount of the votes to be done by mail 279 It has changed the way campaigns will be conducted from limiting large cam paign rallies to different tactics for fundraising The COVID 19 response deaths and the economic effects are expected to have major impacts on the outcome of all aspects of the elections from the Presidential and control of the US Senate and House The COVID 19 pandemic has also changed the way patient care is delivered now and in the future Telemedicine has grown an incredible 4000 during the pan demic and is expected that a significant number of health care visits will continue to be virtual All that is needed is a computer tablet or smartphone for two way video interaction between providers and patients In the United States the laws allowing for reimbursement of telemedicine continue to evolve and the Congress and advo cacy groups are asking private insurers to make telemedicine The COVID 19 pandemic is unfortunate but its occurrence provides an opportu nity to set up a different kind of world where health care can be delivered to all in a cost effective manner where mental health and well being will become mainstream and part of health services and where people will be the priority References 1 Yong SE How the pandemic will end The Atlantic https www theatlantic com health archive 2020 03 how will coronavirus end 608719
